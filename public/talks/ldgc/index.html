# Scientifically efficient üë©‚Äçüî¨

Efficiency is the ratio of the _input_ to the output.

```html
    Animal          1 :  0.8

    Arable          1 :  4.0

    Forest Garden¬π  1 : 40.0

# 7. Establish ground cover

1. Spread bark or wood chip* mulch
2. Plant ground cover
3. Sow temporary cover

![Bark mulch, Vinca minor and Sinapis alba temporary ground cover](img/groundcover.jpg)

???

* *See [Myths, Miracles or Marketing? Wood Chip Mulch](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/lcs/) on [Horticultural Myths](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/lcs/) by Professor Linda Chalker-Scott
* Mark out shrubs with bamboo, write name, height x diameter
* Bark approx 1.5 tonne per 100m¬≤. [Newbridge Sawmills](http://www.jamesdaviessawmills.co.uk/) near Cenarth sells it for ¬£38.50 +VAT per tonne, on industrial trailer only, weekdays.
* For large areas (ie acres), consider wood chipper for mulch & flail mower to keep grass down.
* I have used [Sinapis alba](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Sinapis+alba) (white mustard) with great success, partially overwinters.
