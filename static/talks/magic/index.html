# What is this sorcery?

##¬†Three explanations interlude‚Ä¶

???

* These are some mighty big claims

---

class: center, middle

# 1. Layered 

???

* Trees!
* Canopy Layer
* Shrubs, small trees
* Herbaceous perennials
* Ground cover
* Tubers, rhizomes
* Mushrooms
* Vines

---

class: center, middle

# 2. Perennial

???

* Trees! Take time‚Ä¶
* Overwhelmingly perennial plants
* Established
* Less pest damage
* Self-seeding annuals
* No bare soil -- mulch & living mulch
* Example of sowing Babbingtons Leek

---

class: center, middle

# 3. Self-sustaining

???

* Closed loop - minimal inputs
* Diversity of species
* Nutrients - eg comfrey, nettles, urine
* Pests - ponds, predator strip, perennials
* Habitat for predators
* Living mulch
* **Balance** without intervention

---

class: center, middle

# But how does it work?

---

class: left, middle

# Working with nature

![Climax vegetation](img/climax-vegetation.svg)

* Less energy
* More resilient
* More diverse
* Less maintenance
* Fewer greenhouse gas emissions

???

* Your garden wants to be a forest garden!!

# Scientifically efficient üë©‚Äçüî¨

```html
Animal          1 :  0.8

Arable          1 :  4.0

Forest Garden¬π  1 : 40.0
```

Efficiency is the ratio of the _input_ to the output.

* Proviso: once established
* Perennial plants are less work
* No compost bins, compost in situ

# Three explanations again

1. Layered
2. Perennial
3. Self-sustaining

???

* A tangle of green
* Untidy your mind

# Part 2: Seven Practical Things

<div style="float:left;">
_In order_

1. Plan
2. Plant windbreaks
3. Plant canopy
4. Propagate ground cover
5. Sheet mulch
6. Establish ground cover
7. Plant shrubs
</div>
<img src="img/northface.jpg" alt="Forest Garden Wales‚Äô North Face border" width="50%" style="float: right">

???

* Image from Forest Garden Wales, North Face windbreak

---

# 1. Plan

* What harvest & plants?
* [Rootstocks](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/rootstock-reference/) & diameters
* Windbreaks 
* Nutrient budget
* Access, structures, utilities
* Scale plan ([CAD software](http://www.qcad.org/en/) or paper)

???

* Don‚Äôt forget to plan your nutrients ‚Äì pp57 Creating a Forest Garden
* Get a soil sample from CCF
* OS map from [The Map Centre](https://www.themapcentre.com/), about ¬£40

---

# Here‚Äôs one I made earlier

![CAD plan of forest garden](img/plan.png)

Calculate areas (ground cover), position trees (diameters)

???

* Drawing made in [QCAD](http://www.qcad.org/en/)

---

# 2. Plant windbreaks

* [Elaeagnus umbellata](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+umbellata) (autumn olive)
* [Hippophae rhamnoides](https://www.pfaf.org/USER/plant.aspx?LatinName=Hippophae+rhamnoides) (sea buckthorn)
* [Viburnum opulus](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus) (guelder rose)
* [Amelanchier canadensis](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Amelanchier+canadensis) (juneberry)
* [Cornus sericea](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Cornus+sericea) (red osier dogwood)

![Montage of Amelanchier canadensis berries, Elaeagnus umbellata berries and Viburnum opulus berries](img/windbreaks.jpg)

???

* Examples that have worked well for us
* All available as cheap bare-root hedging plants
* Don‚Äôt forget [Rosa rugosa](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rosa+rugosa) (japanese rose)

# 3. Plant canopy trees

* [Rootstock!](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/rootstock-reference/)
* Fruit trees  [www.orangepippin.com](https://www.orangepippin.com/apples)
* Nut trees - squirrels & [Castanea sativa](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Castanea+sativa)
* Nitrogen fixing - [Alnus cordata](https://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Alnus+cordata)

_Considerations:_

* Tree spacing ¬º‚Äì¬Ω of combined tree diameters
* Plant small trees under high trees
* [Only stake dwarf rootstock (M26 & smaller)](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/don-t-stake-fruit-trees/)
* Pollinating partners
* Wind exposure

???

* Small trees under eg Alnus cordata, can raise canopy
* Don‚Äôt forget rabbit guards, super cheap [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/100-SPIRAL-TREE-GUARDS-60cm/dp/B0041Z90TM/) 22p each
* No Castanea sativa imports

---

# 4. Propagate ground cover

* [Rubus nepalensis](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=rubus+nepalensis) (nepalese raspberry)
* [Vinca minor](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Vinca+minor) (lesser periwinkle)

# 5. Sheet mulch

* Quality plastic woven sheet mulch, 3-4m wide
* Re-usable metal pegs
* **Weigh it down!**
* 6 months grass, 12 months dandelions
* Consider using less more efficiently!

![Woven plastic sheet mulch weighed down with wood](img/sheetmulch.jpg)

---

# 6. Establish ground cover

1. Mark out shrubs
2. Put down bark or wood chip*
4. Plant ground cover
5. Sow temporary cover

![Bark mulch, Vinca minor and Sinapis alba temporary ground cover](img/groundcover.jpg)

???

* *See [Myths, Miracles or Marketing? Wood Chip Mulch](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/lcs/) on [Horticultural Myths](https://puyallup.wsu.edu/lcs/) by Professor Linda Chalker-Scott
* Mark out shrubs with bamboo, write name, height x diameter
* Bark approx 1.5 tonne per 100m¬≤. [Newbridge Sawmills](http://www.jamesdaviessawmills.co.uk/) near Cenarth sells it for ¬£38.50 +VAT per tonne, on industrial trailer only, weekdays.
* For large areas (ie acres), consider wood chipper for mulch & flail mower to keep grass down. 
* I have used [Sinapis alba](https://www.pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Sinapis+alba) (white mustard) with great success, partially overwinters.
* I bulk bought 27kg Sinapis alba from [Cotswold Seeds](https://www.cotswoldseeds.com/product/mustard-sinapis-alba) for ¬£50.

# 7. Plant shrubs

* Bamboo
* Chaenomeles spp.
* Mahonia spp.
* Phormium spp.
* Rosa rugosa
