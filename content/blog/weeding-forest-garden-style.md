In the chapter on Maintenance in [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/), Martin Crawford says 

> I very rarely dig up weeds… instead I just chop them off at soil level

In the damp weeks that followed the summer’s drought, there was a lot of growth and a lot of weeding. The mineral accumulating [docks](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rumex+obtusifolius), [dandelions](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Taraxacum+officinale) and [plantains](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Plantago+lanceolata) were cut and left to compost in situ. This is in much the same way as you “chop ’n‘ drop” [comfrey](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Symphytum+uplandicum) under fruit trees. Just imagine, no wheelbarrow, no compost heap, much less bother 🙂
