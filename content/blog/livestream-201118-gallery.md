## [Forest Garden Livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/forestgardenwales/)
### _Wednesday 18th November, 10am GMT_

When I started out with forest gardening, I wish I’d had a decent photograph of an [Autumn Olive](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+umbellata) to hand, as I planted my windbreak hedge far too close to the path!

This [Wednesday’s livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/forestgardenwales/), I’m introducing the [ForestGardenGallery.uk](https://forestgardengallery.uk) and how you can help out with assembling an extensive and useful photo gallery of forest garden plants.

I’ve been collaborating on a spreadsheet of all the plants in Martin Crawford’s [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/), using data from [Plants For A Future](https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx) website.

There are about 435 plants, and the idea is to find 8 different photos of each plant (leaf, fruit, seedling etc). That’s 3,480 photos to find 😲!!! So, I’m looking to build up a network of volunteers for this rather mammoth task 🐘.

I’ll walk through what work is required, both research and editing, then explain the spreadsheets, and then look at how the gallery software functions.

There will be [an informal Zoom Q&A](https://us04web.zoom.us/j/75260550111?pwd=enk3VCtIUzJKVlJtbXhrdHdFeUY4UT09) afterwards as well. Bring your own biscuits 🍰.

## [Robert Kourick on Growing Greener](https://www.thomaschristophergardens.com/podcasts/robert-kourik-the-hidden-half-of-your-plants)

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1605645059/robert-kourik-website.png" alt="Screenshot of gardeners website" caption="90s-stylee website, seriously interesting book" >}}

On my second [favourite gardening podcast](https://www.thomaschristophergardens.com/podcasts/) is a [fantastic episode](https://www.thomaschristophergardens.com/podcasts/robert-kourik-the-hidden-half-of-your-plants) with [Robert Kourik](https://robertkourik.com/), from way back when in November 2019 (remember those pre-Covid days?). It’s so good, I’ve listened to it twice. He talks about the hidden world of roots and how they’re overlooked. Tree roots extend further than you think, feeding roots often point upwards, and a “donut mulch” is a more efficient way to distribute nutrients. Fascinating.

## [The Backyard Forest online course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-backyard-forest/learn/?referralCode=CE87DB2FC1CA1B28807F)

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1598957091/backyard-forest-screenshot-captions.jpg" alt="Screenshot of course in action" >}}

I must confess, my paid garden design work has taken precedence over my extra [walkthroughs](https://www.forestgarden.wales/walkthroughs/) for my [online forest garden course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-backyard-forest/learn/?referralCode=CE87DB2FC1CA1B28807F). All I can say is, well, bills! 

It is tricky to get over that “income hump”, so that I can afford to spend more time on new material. Possibly I need to do the thing I swore I’d never do, namely write articles for free in exchange for promotion 🤔
