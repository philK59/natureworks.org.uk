First off, here‚Äôs my simple, pot-bound, bung-it-in-together [tomato pur√©e recipe](http://simp.ly/p/bcRzGy). TL;DR don‚Äôt fret, chuck it in a pot.

I‚Äôve been thinking about perennial vegetables a great deal, and I am finally getting round to creating some perennial veg beds in the orchard part of the forest garden. Trouble is, I never really grew many annual vegetables before creating a forest garden, and it‚Äôs actually really involved and time-consuming, particularly if you don‚Äôt know where to start.

Harvest time, paradoxically, can be the most overwhelming time. Rather than being gloriously thankful for bumper crops, you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúwhat the heck am I going to do with all this produce?‚Äù. That is when the veg anxiety kicks in.

My way of dealing with this has been to concentrate on one vegetable at a time. Tomatoes are good now, and this year has been the year of the aubergine for me (a good compost mulch plus regular watering is my tip). 

On the harvest front, I have been simplifying my recipes and bunging stuff in a pot! In our first year here, I was _roasting_ tomatoes before pur√©eing them. They tasted glorious but took an age. Now, I put everything in a pot (see my [tomato pur√©e recipe](http://simp.ly/p/bcRzGy)).

Today, I thought, why not green tomato pur√©e? So, this is where I‚Äôm going. Fingers crossed & no big worry if it doesn‚Äôt work, as no experiment fails üôÇ
