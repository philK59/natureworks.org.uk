We need to protect and restore our wildlife whilst dramatically reducing our [Greenhouse Gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas) emissions, which means **sustainable** food production on a global scale, something that can only happen with public awareness, understanding and support.

Wildlife and edible gardening in public spaces creates habitat for wildlife, crops for people and, just as importantly, it can foster this understanding of where our food comes from, whilst connecting different parts of society with nature.

My proposal is to **facilitate community groups and schools creating [forest garden](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/what-is-a-forest-garden/) strips on public land, leading to and joining wild spaces**. That is the essence of Wild Food Corridors.

Iâ€™m currently putting together just such a proposal for a site in Aberystwyth, and the feedback from the council, conservationist, community centre and primary school has been overwhelmingly positive.

Forest gardening is ideally suited to such an endeavour, because itâ€™s low maintenance, productive and sustainable, with the whole focus on creating wildlife friendly habitats for pollinators and predators, natural fertility and a living ground cover.

There will be a balance of native and non-native species in all the [seven layers](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/seven-layers-forest-garden/), including:

* [Hawthorn](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crataegus) ([native](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+monogyna) and [good fruiting](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+arnoldiana) species), [hazel](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Corylus+avellana) and [willow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow)
* [Apple, pear, plum and cherry](https://www.orangepippin.com) trees, on suitable [rootstock](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/rootstock-reference/)
* Sterile [Bocking 14 comfrey](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Symphytum+officinale), for chop and drop mulching
* Ground cover such as [Alefoot](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Glechoma+hederacea), [Periwinkle](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Vinca+minor), [Apple Mint](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Mentha+suaveolens), [Horse Mint](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Mentha+longifolia)
* Fruit bushes such as [gooseberry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ribes+uva-crispa), [raspberry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Rubus+idaeus), [currants](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Ribes+rubrum), thornless [bramble](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+fruticosus)
* All-year round flowering herbaceous perennials for pollinators, such as [Meadowsweet](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Filipendula+ulmaria), [Sweet Cicely](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Myrrhis+odorata), [Cow Parsley](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Anthriscus+sylvestris), [Dandelion](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Taraxacum+officinale) 

At the very heart of the project is the idea of bringing people and nature together, of involving people in the production of food and protection of wildlife.

Obviously, I have taken much inspiration from other people: [Sara Venn](https://twitter.com/Saralimback), found of [Edible Bristol](http://ediblebristol.org.uk), the [Incredible Edible](https://www.incredibleedible.org.uk) movement, [The Peopleâ€™s Orchard project](http://www.stdogmaelsabbey.org.uk/peoplesorchard) in Pembrokeshire, [Martin Allen](http://martinjallen.com) ([@BotanicalMartin](https://mobile.twitter.com/BotanicalMartin)) whose photo is featured above, my forest gardening neighbour [Dan]() and many more. Thank you all ðŸ™‚
