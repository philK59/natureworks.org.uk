If you're planning to plant trees and bushes, some are better than others for diversity, with for example an oak supporting almost 20 times as many leaf-eating insect species as a sycamore, and rhododendrons emerging as the sad losers with the Eurovision equivalent of 'nil point'. Insect diversity matters because insects means food, and food means wildlife!

The science, though, should be observed with the following cautionary points in mind:

👉 We highlight strongly that these figures are for leaf-eating insects only. There are many more wildlife species associated with trees, including fungi, lichens, pollen and nectar eaters, and species associated with dead-wood and leaf litter. For example, sycamore has especially rich wildlife communities living on the bark, and it is also an important nectar source in summer when few other trees are flowering. Many tree species have wildlife species particular to them, even if their overall total is relatively small.

👉 No single woodland will contain all of the species associated with its constituent tree species.

👉 Trees of the same species in different geographical areas of Britain will have different sets of associated insects.

👉 Species diversity is not the same as biomass. A tree species may have relatively few insect species associated with it, but if the insects which are associated with it occur in huge numbers (e.g. aphids on sycamore) then that tree may harbour an enormously important source of food for other animals. A tree's value for wildlife does not therefore necessarily correlate to the number of species directly associated with it.

👉 No one individual tree of a particular species will harbour all the species of insects known to be associated with that tree species.

👉 The value of individual trees for wildlife depends upon the age of the tree, and older trees have a much greater variety of microhabitats available for colonisation.

❗️As always, buying native grown in your local nursery is important for biosecurity: see https://www.facebook.com/wildlifegardeningforum/posts/117346179804739
