I‚Äôve been asking friends and colleagues for feedback about what would make a good online course for forest gardening. Not only has this been an excellent excuse to catch up via a video call with some lovely people, it has also been **really** educational. 

What is striking is the desire for the **process to be simplified**, clearing a path so that people can feel comfortable learning to get started. This _doesn‚Äôt_ mean simplifying gardening, rather it means making it more accessible.

So, I made a 10 page slideshow to help my friends out called **[Forest Garden Overview](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/overview/#1)**, think of it as an aerial view! 

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1544816108/hawthorn-IMAG1960.jpg" alt="Bunches of white hawthorn blossom" caption="The native Hawthorn is a fantastic wildlife tree, habitat and food source" >}} 

If that‚Äôs TL;DR, then here‚Äôs the content summarised even more:

1. Useful - plants that are useful to humans and other life forms!
2. Native - native plants are generally better for native wildlife
3. Aspect - figure out the orientation of your garden
4. Soil - find out your soil type
5. Structure - think in layers when designing your garden
6. Choosing plants - two great websites for helping you choose plants [PFAF](https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx) and [RHS](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/Search-Form) 

If the slideshow‚Äôs not _enough_ for you, I made my first ever screencast, 20 minutes long, explaining the presentation (please note, unshaved & unedited, with lots of ‚Äúums‚Äù in!)

As you can probably gather by now, I‚Äôm as interested by wildlife gardening as by forest gardening, indeed, I believe they are mutually compatible. By gardening with someone else in mind, we start gardening for everyone üôÇ
