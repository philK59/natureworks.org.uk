In my previous life as web designer, I attended the leftfield tech conference [dConstruct](http://2012.dconstruct.org) back in 2012. Recently, in a random email search moment, I came across a quote from [James Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Burke_%28science_historian%29):

> “The unexplored no-man’s-land between disciplines”

And I thought, a forest garden is very much an in-betweeny discipline, an intersectional discipline if you will. Almost Frankensteinian as it’s part vegetable, part wildlife, part ornamental garden. The focus is on creating edible crops; working with nature to encourage wildlife is an intrinsic part, as the garden provides its own nutrients, mulch and pest control; the ornamental aspect because it’s a garden to spend time in.

I also thought, I’m getting a clearer idea of my calling. Reading [‘A New Garden Ethic’](https://newsociety.com/Books/N/A-New-Garden-Ethic) by [Benjamin Vogt](https://www.monarchgard.com) has reinforced the importance of native plants and creating resilient ecosystems in a time of climate and extinction emergency. And it all fits together: the forest garden is the **ideal** place to promote and integrate native plants into our gardens, as it relies so heavily on a healthy ecosystem for its own functioning.

My project for 2020 is to properly explore native plant design and create a native plant design online course. And this is **immensely** exciting 😀
