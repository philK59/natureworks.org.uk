[Permaculture Tywi](https://twitter.com/permatywi), a permaculture group from the Tywi Valley in Wales, came on a magnificent forest garden tour on Saturday 23rd June, [as previously reported](http://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/permaculture-tywi-tour/). 

Iâ€™m very lucky that Christine Jones and others took photographs â€“ I keep meaning to but I find myself too busy talking. Thought it would be nice to share some of the photos. Apologies, I didnâ€™t get everyoneâ€™s name so I canâ€™t caption them properly!
