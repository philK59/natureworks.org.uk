I‚Äôm revamping my free mini-course, all about creating a forest garden plan. Firstly, it‚Äôs been renamed Backyard Forest and rewritten, to appeal to people with not-large gardens. Secondly, I‚Äôm reshooting all the video. Finally, I‚Äôm adding lots of goodies, like a PDF checklist, CAD template and video walkthroughs.

I‚Äôm also working on a full online course called Backyard Forest. I was going to use [Teachable](https://teachable.com/), a really good platform but pricey. I‚Äôm [not popular enough to wear pink](https://youtu.be/PpcxODYI-1c?t=13) (Simpsons cultural reference there), so I‚Äôm going with the cheap and cheerful [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). The good news for you is that the free mini-course will be, er, free and the full course will only be about ¬£20. The bad news for me is that I will never be a millionaire üßê

In the [Livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/forestgardenwales), I‚Äôll go over the key points of the mini-course, plus a live demo of creating a CAD plan from scratch. I will be covering ground that I‚Äôve visited previously (forest garden definition, key things to survey, difference between planning and designing etc). Just so you‚Äôre warned!

Because of coronavirus, Udemy is really busy, so the launch proper won‚Äôt be until mid-June. But I will upload an exclusive password-protected preview onto Vimeo for anyone who comes along to the Livestream chat or Zoom Q&A. 

Also, I‚Äôll be answering any forest garden planning and design questions you may have, and you can email questions in advance <hello@forestgarden.wales>

## Forest Garden Plants

Recording of yesterday‚Äôs Forest Garden Plants walkaround, the [video now on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIchcsyie-Q). Blog post listing plants are [online just for you](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/forest-garden-plants-2020/). Thank you to everyone who watched and came along to the Zoom Q&A, your support is really appreciated üôè. Hazel asked if I could do a Lockdown Livestream on alliums. I don‚Äôt know much about them to be honest, beyond the half dozen that I grow, best I point people toward [Stephen Barstow](https://www.edimentals.com/blog/) for someone who really [knows his onions](https://www.edimentals.com/blog/?s=allium).
