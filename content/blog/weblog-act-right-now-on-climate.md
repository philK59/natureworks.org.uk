I went on the local [Strike4Climate](https://www.schoolstrike4climate.com) demonstration with my two children on Friday, part of their education in our democratic ways. In the morning we painted some placards and then we watched [Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg) giving [her TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/greta_thunberg_the_disarming_case_to_act_right_now_on_climate/up-next):

Some people say “but what do I do?”. The answer is simple and two-fold:

1. Reduce your consumption.
2. Engage & demand action from your political representatives (eg a [Green New Deal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal)).

It’s a wake up call: we need to change how we live, because everything we love is under threat. And that includes bumblebees.
