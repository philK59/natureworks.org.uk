title: Your small garden can be a forest garden

description: The term ‚Äúforest garden‚Äù can be misleading. It‚Äôs neither forest-sized nor a forest, so rest assured that your small garden can be transformed into a forest garden.

One drawback with forest gardening is the name. Firstly, it emulates the _edge_ of a woodland, not the deepest, darkest depths of a forest. And secondly, you most definitely **can** have a small forest garden, because it‚Äôs about the _principles_ rather than the size. The principles are:

1. **Productive:** this means food, possibly twine or canes, and it also applies to plants that support the garden, eg [flowers for pollinators & predators](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/top-10-bee-friendly-plants/), plants for nutrients like [comfrey](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Symphytum+uplandicum) and [Broom](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Cytisus+scoparius), and even pretty flowers to encourage the humans outside.
2. **Multi-layered:** the garden is in 3D! This means using all the space, vertically with trees and climbers, a shrub layer and a ground cover. With a small garden, you need to make sure you choose the right-sized tree, which in the case of fruiting trees means a small [rootstock](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/rootstock-reference/), eg an M27 for apples or Gisela 5 for a cherry. 
3. **No-dig permanent ground cover:** you want to keep the ground covered and undisturbed as much as possible, as this encourages soil life. There‚Äôs a [large range of ground cover plants](https://pfaf.org/user/cmspage.aspx?pageid=81), that don‚Äôt need mowing, which you can use for different situations. 
4. **Sustainable:** by using mineral accumulator plants for nutrients (and human urine!) you don‚Äôt need to apply fertilisers or create compost. Likewise, by encouraging healthy soil, pollinators and predators, you eliminate the need for pesticides. The whole garden is self-sustaining.
5. **Low maintenance:** once the forest garden is established, the majority of the work is harvesting. There is little weeding because of the ground cover, no compost to make unless you‚Äôre growing annual vegetables, no mowing unless you have a lawn (and even then, I‚Äôd recommend a mini-meadow with paths), no watering unless you have plants in pots. 

Because of the name, you‚Äôll find that people call a forest garden a [food forest](https://permaculturenews.org/2011/10/21/why-food-forests/), an [edible landscape](http://www.ediblelandscaping.co.uk) or even [a foodscape](https://gardenculturemagazine.com/featured-articles/foodscaping-a-new-way-to-create-a-garden/)!

Whatever you call it, your small garden can be one üôÇ.
