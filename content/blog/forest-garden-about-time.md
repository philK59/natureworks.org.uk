description: It’s about time forest gardening reached a wider audience. Nevertheless, a garden is also about time; a seasonal, cyclical time. Herein lies some temporal whimsy…

It started with [a tweet](https://twitter.com/AmielWayne/status/1075685635812458497) by [@AmielWayne ](https://mobile.twitter.com/AmielWayne):

I was inspired to make a forest garden calendar, although rather predictably this hasn’t happened in time for 2019. I thought it would be fun to ask for forest garden photo contributions, and then crowdfund the production of the calendars (a single calendar costs about £15 _each_ from someone like [VistaPrint](https://www.vistaprint.co.uk)).

And then my eye was caught by the [one line a day, five year memory book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0811870197/). This is such a simple and elegant idea—one day, repeated across five years. So when you write your entry, you have instant recall across the years. I think this would be _ideal_ for gardeners, noting the small details such as flowering times, extreme weather events, notable achievements. As you may have noticed, I keep a web [log](https://www.forestgarden.wales/tags/log/) but I find it hard to navigate back through the years.

And then, whilst gardening I took to thinking. (This happens a lot.) How about a single, composite photo of the forest garden year?

That doesn’t really work for me, the months don’t read well vertically. So, how about an online 5 year photo memory diary? Each day you enter a new photo, you’re shown the photo that you published one, two, three years ago.

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1546191855/time-photodiary.jpg" alt="Sketch of two photos on the same day, separated by a year" caption="My imagined online photo memory diary" >}}

Ah, but time, particularly in the garden, has a seasonally cyclical nature. Time in a circle, revisiting the same but different places known as months.

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1546191856/time-circle.jpg" alt="Months in a circle divided by 12" caption="My imagined time in a circle" >}}

The trouble with this is that 16:9 ratio photos just don’t sit well in a 1/12th slice of pie. Also, how do you signify the _passing_ of time over the years? I feel a spiral coming on, a mobius strip-like spiral, revisiting the same but different places.

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1546191847/time-spiral.jpg" alt="A spiral, passing through the same months on the way up" caption="My imagined time spiral" >}}

The point is that just a simple idea, like the 5 year memory book, can dramatically alter how you view and remember your garden. Time is not an arrow but a spiral, and there is so much more scope than just the linear representations of “traditional” digital photo albums.
