Greetings & welcome back to my blog! I’ll be writing weekly about forest gardens, as well as [livestreaming](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/livestream/) regularly.

I have been busy, building this website [natureworks.org.uk](https://www.natureworks.org.uk) and moving my courses to [Gumroad](https://natureworksgarden.gumroad.com/), although you can get them straight from the [courses page](/courses/).

I’m also open to new wildlife and forest garden design work, please see [my portoflio](/portfolio/) for examples.
