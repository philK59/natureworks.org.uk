We had our first forest garden [tour](/tour/) and [workshop](/workshop/) last week, via [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/users/show/233536194). A bit nerve-wracking but eminently enjoyable. I used the same itinerary for both the two hour tour and the six hour workshop. I feel the cyclical process works well in both situations, the workshop is an extension with more detail and practical applications.

This is a snapshot of the intinerary, I‚Äôm keeping a ‚Äúlive‚Äù version on [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com) updated, as it‚Äôs easier to print from <http://simp.ly/publish/wj614M>

## FGW itinerary

C. Timetable  
D. Reference

## A. Theory

### 1. [Definition](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/what-is-a-forest-garden/) of a forest garden

1. Productive: produce, layers
2. Sustainable: wildlife, pests, nutrients, inputs, carbon
3. Low maintenance: watering, weeding, digging, fertilising, compost

Wildlife orchard underplanted with edible shrubs & perennial vegetables. [7 layers](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/seven-layers-forest-garden/).

### 2. Start with wants

* Harvest: fruits, nuts, seeds, spices, herbs, mushrooms, poles, canes, string
* Space: People centered ‚Äúwho, what & when‚Äù
* Time
* Money

### 3. Climax vegetation

* Woodland -> Forest garden -> Orchard -> Pasture -> Arable
* Increased: energy, fragility, uniformity, maintenance, greenhouse gas emissions

> Gently balance the garden  
> On the cusp of woodland  
> With minimal effort  

### 4. Efficiency

Energy input:output
```
* Animal        1: 0.8
* Arable        1: 4.0
* Forest garden 1:40.0
```
<!--BREAK-->
## B. Practical

### 1. Survey

* Measure aspects: soil, water, boundaries, paths, slopes, orientation, views, footpaths, utilities, structures, access, privacy etc
* Mapping: tape measure, satellite, OS map - accuracy

### 2. Plan

1. List what you want & have (three W's; time, money, space). Zoning.
2. Purpose of plan: fit the use and trees with the space. 
3. Plan access, windbreaks, canopy, name areas (computer or paper).

### 3. Propagate

* Start ground cover & windbreaks now
* Rudimentary propagation bed. Flowers & veg!

### 4. Windbreaks

* Calculate position, height, width (nurse tree)
* Choose - aspect, light, soil

### 5. Canopy

Critical. **[Spacing](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/tree-spacing-forest-garden/)**, pollination, protection

### 6. Sheet mulch

Area, material, time

### 7. Shrubs

Spacing, light, access. Mark chalk circles.

### 8. Ground cover

Wood chip, spacing, shade, temporary ground cover
