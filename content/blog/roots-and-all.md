[Sarah Wilson](https://www.wilsonvokins.com) put out [a review](http://traffic.libsyn.com/rootsandall/BonusEpContentReview-2.mp3) of all past [Roots and All](https://rootsandall.co.uk) [podcasts](https://rootsandall.co.uk/thepodcast/) & [budcasts](https://rootsandall.co.uk/budcasts/). I like a good list, so I typed them all up. Halfway through, I realised how many there are but it was too late to give up.
