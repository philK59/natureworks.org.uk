This is the first year we grew [Groundcherries](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/physalis.html) AKA Cape Gooseberries AKA [Physalis peruviana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physalis_peruviana). Apparently the French call them _amour en cage_ (“love in a cage”).

I thought the crop was a bit of a disaster. The plants took ages to establish, and then rocketed skywards in August, reaching over 2 metres in height (not the 1 metre advertised!). Plenty of flowers but very little fruit was setting.

When we came back from holiday, a hard frost appeared to have killed everything. Due to natural laziness, the flopping great foliage was left in a tangle in a polytunnel for a few weeks. And then I discovered that a fair bit of the fruit had ripened on the plants, and also that many of the Groundcherry plants were still alive.

I’ve harvested what I can, and the fruits are really delicious – tart, sweet and flavoursome. They are on the small side (though apparently genetically modified Groundcherries are [being developed](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/groundcherry-fruit-gene-editing-berries-strawberries-physalis-a8563276.html) 🙄). With the remainder of the fruit, I’ll be making a vegan Groundcherry cheesecake.

I’ve started putting the plant remains on the compost and I noticed that the root systems are really well established:

The roots are so well developed, I am going to try The Groundcherry Experiment: overwintering three pruned plants in the polytunnel with a lot of straw and fleece. I’ve also taken one plant into the frost-free shed. If they do survive, I might have a headstart next year and a bigger & better harvest. Otherwise, it’s back to [Real Seeds](http://www.realseeds.co.uk/physalis.html) for more seed.
