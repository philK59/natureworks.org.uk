Someone on the [Forest Garden UK](https://www.facebook.com/groups/405281259629562/) group on Facebook is setting up a Community Food Forest in Middlesborough. (Food Forest is a user-friendly way of saying Forest Garden, I think it’s a more descriptive term.) 

I floated the idea of a checklist for anyone else wanting to do the same thing, a quick reference guide. 

This is very much a work in progress, so I’ll update this page if I have any suggestions or feedback.

Interested in setting up a community food forest? A list of what you will need and useful things.

1. **People!**  
A small, dedicated core of people who have the grit to see the project through.
* **Aims**  
A clear idea of what kind of food forest you want, with simple and achievable goals.
* **Volunteers**  
More people, invaluable for the grunt work required. Gardening clubs are a good place to look, and cake is a worthy incentive.
* **Land**  
A site for the food forest. It needs to have [secure land tenure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_tenure) for the project to have stability, and not rely solely on goodwill. Depending on your site, access and security may be an issue.
* **Official support**  
Get the town/county/city council onside and supporting your cause. Promote your garden in the local press, which also helps get more volunteers.
