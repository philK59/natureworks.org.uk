As part of my weekly, free, lockdown special livestreams, last Wednesday 29th April, I talked about perennial vegetables and their place in the forest garden. As always, this was livestreamed on my [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.com/forestgardenwales).

I also had my first ever guest! My friend Martin Hayes is a fantastic orchardist, with years of experience planting and pruning fruit trees. His website is [theapplemancan.uk](https://theapplemancan.uk/), email <hello@theapplemancan.uk>.

I’ve edited the videos together into one tasty chunk, and the slides are available online:
