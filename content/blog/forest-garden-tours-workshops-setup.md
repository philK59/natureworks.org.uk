I’ve organised the forest garden [tours](/tour/) and [workshops](/workshop/) for 2019. I decided to market them as [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/) holiday [Experiences](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/Ceredigion/experiences?query=Ceredigion&place_id=ChIJcYOiuisEb0gR1zA-l2ZepU0&refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fexperiences) because it is a _vast_ amount of work to manage an online shop, calendar and publicity.

Sure, Airbnb take 20% of the ticket price (£27 for the tour, £75 for the workshop) but I also wanted to be flexible and spread available slots from April to September, rather than just have monthly, fixed events. I might well end up with a couple of guests for an all day workshop, which is fine because at the end of the season I’ll have a clear idea which days and months are the most popular.

To help spread the word, and also to dip my toe into the world of Facebook events, I’m also running fixed, monthly discounted tours and workshops via [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/jake-rayson-17248421654) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pg/forestgardenwales/events/). The ticket prices are £22 (£5 less) for the tour and £65 (£10 less) for the workshop.

It got a bit messy with Facebook, as you can only repeat an event for up to 3 months!

Over the next month, I’ll posting more workshop material and virtual tour videos. Please help spread the #ForestGarden workshop word!
