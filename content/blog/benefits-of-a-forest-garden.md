Forest gardening is a productive, low maintenance, wildlife friendly way to garden. Itâ€™s like a perennial vegetable plot, orchard and wildlife garden rolled into one. Here are four demonstrable benefits:

1. **Low maintenance** â€“Â by design, forest gardens require far less work than traditional gardens. The majority of plants are perennial, so thereâ€™s minimal watering. There is a permanent living ground cover, so weeding is passing affair. The greatest amount of work is mowing the grass paths and harvesting the produce.
2. **Productive** â€“ a forest garden is a _productive_ garden. This is usually edible crops (fruit, nuts, leaves, mushrooms, tubers etc) but it can also include dyes, firewood and building materials. And productive is a gloriously flexible word, encompassing aesthetics, people-space and a wildlife observatory.
3. **Biodiversity** â€“Â a forest garden **[works with nature](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/)** to create edible crops, so that all the nutrients, minerals, pollinators and pest predators are encouraged to make a home. This makes it wildlife friendly by default. 
4. **Resilient** â€“ diversity is a critical feature of a forest garden. There is a wide range of available cropping plants and also a huge range of beneficial plants that donâ€™t have a direct harvest (also known as system plants). These include pollinator friendly, ground cover and mineral accumulator plants. This network of diversity strengthens the garden as a whole, as well as providing alternatives should one particular crop fail.

Oh, and forest gardens are innately _beautiful_ spaces. This is a subjective and biased opinion, so it doesnâ€™t rate a bullet point but it is entirely true ðŸ˜‰.
