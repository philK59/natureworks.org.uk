Edited notes from the [Radical Mycology](https://radicalmycology.com/) [book](http://www.chthaeus.com/Radical-Mycology-by-Peter-McCoy-p/b-rmp.htm) by [Peter McCoy](https://radicalmycology.com/peters-bio/). Handy knowledge when [making your own mycorrhizal inoculant](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/make-your-own-mychorrizal-inoculum/).

1. [Arbuscular (endo)mycorrhizal](#arbuscular-endo-mycorrhizal-plants-80-90-)
2. [Non-mycorrhizal](non-mycorrhizal-plants-5-)
3. [Ectomycorrhizal](ectomycorrhizal-ecm-plants-5-)

## 1. Arbuscular (Endo)mycorrhizal plants (80-90%)

The majority of wild plants, including shrubs, wildflowers and broad leaf trees associate with AM, as do redwood, cedar and juniper trees. These include:

* Almost all groups of Pteridophyta
* Most groups of Gymnospermae
* Majority of families in the Angiospermae
* All palms
* All plants in the Bryophyta
* Almost all bulb plants
* Anything related to roses, apples, peaches, pears, strawberries etc.
* Most tropical plants (apart from orchids)
* Majority of horticultural species
* Almost all crop plants
* All _cultivated_ grasses
* Shrubs and foliage plants except for Rhododendron, Azalea and Heath
* Berries except for blueberries, cranberries and lingonberries
* Nut trees except pecan, hazelnuts and filberts
* Fruit trees including tropical fruits
* Many wetland/aquatic species except rushes and horsetails

## 2. Non-mycorrhizal plants (5%)

### Brassicaceae

* Broccoli
* Brussels
* Cabbage
* Cauliflower
* Collards
* Kale
* Rutabaga

### Others

* Beet
* Carnation
* Mustard
* Orchids
* Protea
* Rush
* Sedge
* Spinach

## 3. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) plants (5%)

Primary plant families:

* Pinaceae
* Fagaceae
* Betulaceae
* Salicaceae
* Dipterocarpaceae

Some species in the Cupressaceae and most species in the Myrtaceae and Caesalpinoideae also form ECM.

Some plant groups that benefit from ectomycorrhizal fungi include:

* Alder (endo/ecto)
* Arborvitae
* Arctostaphylos
* Aspen (endo/ecto)
* Basswood
* Beech
* Birch
* Chestnut
* Chinquapin
* Cottonwood (endo/ecto)
* Douglas-Fir
* Eucalyptus
* Filbert
* Fir
* Hazelnut
* Hickory
* Hemlock
* Larch
* Linden
* Madrone
* Manzanita
* Oak
* Pecan
* Pine
