We’ve planted [Amelanchier canadensis](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Amelanchier+canadensis), [Elaeagnus umbellata](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Elaeagnus+Umbellata), [Berberis darwinii](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Berberis+darwinii) and [Viburnum opulus](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Viburnum+opulus) in the northern double-width windbreak hedge of the [Ornamental Forest Garden](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/introducing-ornamental-maintenance-free-forest-garden/). They’ve all grown well in the existing forest garden and they’re all available as cheap hedging plants. The Berberis has been chosen because it’s evergreen and is planted by the wildlife pond, so there should be less leaf fall into the pond.

However, there’s a **lot** of [bramble](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+fruticosus) and [nettle](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Urtica+dioica), fine forest garden plants in their own right but not what you want in the midst of an establishing windbreak hedge.

After digging out most of the bramble, we’re using woven plastic sheet mulch to kill off the rest. We’ve planted a single line **between** the two rows, so that the sheet can be re-used. There are pegs to temporarily hold down the sheet but it’s imperative to put lots of really heavy objects down, otherwise the sheet _will_ take off in the next storm! Also, be sure to put down some wood chip or hay mulch between the gaps.

In year 2, we’ll totally remove the front row of sheet mulch and fold back the rear row onto itself, and then plant the second windbreak row. Then it’s a thick wood chip mulch and plant a cheap and cheerful ground cover plant ([Glechoma hederacea](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Glechoma+hederacea) is a favourite, as it grows well locally). 

The reason why the rear row is folded back onto itself is so that the bramble from next door finds it harder to [tip layer](https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=358) into the hedge. In a few years time, the hedge will thicken up enough so that there’s not enough light for the bramble to grow into the hedge. 

I’d heartily recommend a double width windbreak if you are on an exposed site and if you have the space. Windbreaks really are a key feature of a healthy forest garden.

On the south side of the garden, I’ve planted Yellow Dogwood ([Cornus sericea 'Flaviramea'](Cornus sericea 'Flaviramea')) cuttings. I was going to use the same method but, because there’s no ready supply of wood chip, I can’t take the sheet mulch up from the other forest garden, which means I’ve had to create temporary cardboard mulch mats.

This hopefully buys me a bit of time before I have to put sheet mulch down on either side. And I have my fingers crossed that there’s not a drought this year as I had quite a few Cornus cutting casualties in the heatwave of 2018.
