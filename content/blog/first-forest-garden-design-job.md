I’m proud to have finished my first paid forest garden design. It was a remote job, which I chanced upon via Facebook. The client wanted an outline forest garden plan made, saying:

> “I intend to convert my ⅓ acre seaside patch to a mini forest garden”. 

They seemed to be very pleased with the result, which is always a relief and very satisfying!

> “I'm just delighted with the plan! It's everything I wanted and much more.”

It was all done remotely, so I traced the plot in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) from the satellite view in [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps), and then exported the paths to a <abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr> format. Because I exported the measurement scale as well, it was relatively easy to scale it up to lifesize in [QCAD](https://qcad.org/en/). 

Then the client emailed over a whole bunch of photos from different angles, plus the key measurements. I tweaked the plan to make it more accurate, printed it out on A4 paper and started sketching. <abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr> is great, and really useful for playing with the position of canopy trees, to make sure you end up with enough light between trees. *But* it is fiddly and technical (I’m still learning how to use <abbr title="Non-uniform rational B-spline">[NURBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline)</abbr>) to create smooth curves), so sketching by hand is actually easier in some cases.

Here’s the sketch for where I estimated the lightest parts of the garden to be (if I was onsite, I would use the excellent [Sun Surveyor](https://www.sunsurveyor.com) mobile app to check for light and darks areas at different times of the year):

Then, I sketched out in biro the different areas and footpaths of the garden. I traced this very rough sketch in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) and then imported back it into [QCAD](https://qcad.org/en/), tweaking it to fit. To be honest, it would be easier to sketch directly in CAD, as there is a freehand tool, but I’d need to invest in a [Wacom tablet](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B079QBDTDF/))

Finally, I pulled out my bargain £1 colour pencils and started to sketch in the different plants, paths and features. It’s all very rough but it is _so_ much easier to visualise once you get a bit of colour down. Again, CAD is great but a little bit monochrome & tidy.

And here, for comparison, is the final plan again:
