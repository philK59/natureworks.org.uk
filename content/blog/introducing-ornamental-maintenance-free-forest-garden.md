Yes, you _can_ have it all, beauty _and_ utility. Well, this is what I’m hoping to prove with the Ornamental Forest Garden.

It’s a one acre, greenfield site (previously used as unfertilised rough pasture for cows), bordered by established trees and a track to the south and west, open to the neighbour’s field to the north and abutting the house and garden to the east.

It will be primarily a show garden, to demonstrate the advantages of forest gardening to “conventional” gardeners. One of the things I’ve found with our first forest garden is that it can look a bit, well, **green**! After reading [A Sting in the Tale: My Adventures with Bumblebees](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/22/a-sting-in-the-tale-dave-goulson-review) by [Dave Goulson](https://twitter.com/DaveGoulson), and volunteering for [The People’s Orchard](http://www.stdogmaelsabbey.org.uk/peoplesorchard) project, I’ve becoming increasingly interested in the role of pollinators & beneficial insects in the garden. In forest garden parlance, pollinator friendly plants are called **system plants**, as they provide benefits for the whole garden ecosystem without a direct harvest. This opens up a huge range of options, indeed, I collated [my 10 favourites](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/top-10-bee-friendly-plants/).

So, you can choose a range of pollinator friendly plants that will flower all year round. Combined with brilliant autumn foliage, fruit and structural colour, this means a carefully designed forest garden can zing with visual vibrancy for all 12 months.

Having a limited forest garden palette and mindset is a challenge but it’s also quite liberating. We visited [Farmyard Nurseries](https://farmyardnurseries.co.uk) today to buy plants for the rejuvenated farmyard pond and the sheer range of plants was mind-boggling. By restricting your choice, it can make it easier to choose.

Another advantage of creating the OFG is that I can use it as material for the video and one day on-site courses that I’m currently creating.
