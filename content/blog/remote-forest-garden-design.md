Many people would love to create a forest garden but don’t know where to start. I always recommend Martin Crawford’s [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) book. If you need more help, I can create a forest garden plan, and I can do it remotely with email, photos and [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/). 

Using an outline plan I created for a client in Ireland, these are the steps:

## 1. First ideas

I can set up a free Skype call to find out what you want and to see if the remote design service is what you need. If it is, I’ll put together your ground plan, based on: 

1. Where you are
2. How you use your garden
2. What you want to grow
3. What is there already

## 2. Rough outline

Using maps, I create a rough outline of your garden:

From this outline, I create the first basic plan:

## 3. Measurements

You’ll need to measure your house and garden. It may also help to measure other features, such as ponds, paths and existing plants. Then, by the magic of email, let me know the measurements and I will make the plan more accurate. It also helps a great deal to have a series of photos of the garden from different angles.

The first thing is to work out where the light is, which determines where the tallest plants go:

You also can do this yourself, using an app like [Sun Surveyor](https://www.sunsurveyor.com) on your mobile phone.

## 4. Areas & paths

Using your ground plan and the lighting, I put together the different areas and paths of the garden, which define the shape and use:

## 5. Plants & ideas

This is the really fun bit where the coloured pencils come out! I’ll sketch some ideas for plant combinations and locations, together with thoughts on the placement of different features:

## 6. Final forest garden outline plan

All this leads to the final forest garden outline plan, which I create using [QCAD](https://qcad.org) free software and which I email to you in <abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr> and <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr> format.

The whole process takes about 2-3 days and costs from £100. The initial Skype call is always free!
