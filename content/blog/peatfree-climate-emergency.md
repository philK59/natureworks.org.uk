The peat extraction industry is a microcosm of the wider [Climate Emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming). Using peat-bsed compost and plants contributes to the creation of [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas) and the destruction of wildlife habitats.

So, why do we do it? 

Profit, convenience & ignorance.

* The peat industry is worth a lot of money, and they won’t change unless we, the public, demand the change from our governments, publicise the change and alter our buying habits.
* Peat, which is essentially unripe coal, is easy to extract and transport on an industrial scale.
* Most people don’t know that peat-based compost is very bad for the environment. There is no financial incentive to publicise the fact.

You are not powerless. You can change things:

1. Use PeatFree compost (see [www.peatfree.org.uk](https://www.peatfree.org.uk/) for suggestions & information).
2. Only buy plants from nurseries that use peat-free compost. Ask them.
3. Sign the UK PeatFree petition: <https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/263362>
4. Spread the word. Then spread it some more.
