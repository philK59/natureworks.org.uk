- Mown grass path across rough pasture field, sun shining
- Wood chip path between two beds
- Wood chip path separated from grass path by planks. Hoe standing up by pots.

- Geranium macrrorhizum makes a good ‘boundary’ plant for a grass path
- A perimeter path keeps the bramble from tip-layering into the garden
- A wood chip path is good for high traffic though requires hoeing & topping up
- Grass will creep into a wood chip path unless there’s a barrier

Paths are great.

1. Create areas - part of design process
2. Provide access
3. keep plants in check

Question, what material? Want sustainable materials, not plastic.

1. Grass - great, cheap, hardwearing. But grows everywhere. Not next to delicate flowers. Have to mow every few weeks.
2. Wood chip - good for delicate areas, normally bring it in, requires regular hoeing, & topping up every year or so. good for delicate beds.
3. Hoggin - clay, sand & gravel. Again, imported. Not for vehicles. Big installation

delicate areas, balance between delicate flowers eg alliums, ground cover, and 

What you grow where depends on what you're growing!

Grass creep. Strong ground cover, eg mints, chinese bramble. Mown grass keeps mint in check. Or clumping “boundary plants” eg lemon balm, or geranium macrorrhizum, provide edge to an area without creeping into it, 

Other boundary is physical one eg wooden plank

perimeter path. always recommend one, to keep plants in check and for access.
