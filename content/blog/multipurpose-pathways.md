imageAlt:
- Grass path up side of polytunnel, by bushy green bed
- Mown grass path across rough pasture field, sun shining
- Wood chip path between two beds
- Wood chip path separated from grass path by planks. Hoe standing up by pots.
imageCap:
- Geranium macrrorhizum makes a good ‘boundary’ plant for a grass path
- A perimeter path keeps the bramble from tip-layering into the garden
- A wood chip path is good for high traffic though requires hoeing & topping up
- Grass will creep into a wood chip path unless there’s a barrier
