On Wednesdays at 10am BST, I livestream a free preview of my online forest garden course. It‚Äôs a bit rough around the edges but it does have a lot of info in there.

All videos recorded on my [YouTube Create a Backyard Forest playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3tnDlJcXMk9VLsc_KU0Ovv4spw5X9yIy)
