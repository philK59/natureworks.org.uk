description: The original plan was to slowly build up the forest garden and increase food production. Some rather ridiculous politics means annual vegetables are being pressed into duty at short notice

* hot compost, turn twice a week, cover with plastic sheet to keep water in/out
* annual veg 
* creating perennial veg beds. (the beds are so the people know where the plants are. the plants already know where they are)
* Moving soft fruit production to less dry shady area
* ramping up propagation, with propagation area
