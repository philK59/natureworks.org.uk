On part of the [eco-homes project](/portfolio/berllan-aur/) I’m landscaping, there’s a 2m high clay and shale bank. Unfortunately, much of the hedge was cut back, leaving some Hawthorn, Hazel and Blackthorn. I have replanted the hedge, with a mix of mostly natives. As it’s a northern hedge, the height of the plants isn’t really an issue. 

In a forest garden, grow native plants where you can, as they’ve co-evolved with the wildlife and generally support more species, particularly invertebrates.

Here’s the full list:

* ['Bowles Hybrid' Willow](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Salix+%27Bowles+hybrid%27) x20
* [Holly](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ilex+aquifolium)
* [Hawthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Crataegus+monogyna) 
* [Blackthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+spinosa)
* [Field Maple](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Acer+campestre)
* [Hazel](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Corylus+avellana)
* [Japanese Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Rosa+rugosa)
* [Wayfaring Tree](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+lantana)
* [Barberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Berberis+vulgaris)
* [Cornelian Cherry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Cornus+mas)
* [Autumn Olive](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+umbellata)

Apart from the rose, which was supposed to be a [Dog Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Rosa+canina), the only non-natives are the Cornus mas and the Autumn Olive, I added a couple in for the edible berries. 

I’ll prune the hedge back in a year, taking out the central leaders to encourage the plants to bush out. Pretty sure no-one will really notice the hedge but it will be a fantastic home for wildlife, with edible berries for humans too.
