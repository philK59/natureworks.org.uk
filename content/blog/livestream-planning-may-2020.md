Last week I ran a [seminar on Forest Garden Planning](https://youtu.be/zSHvqy5Zvng) for the [National Forest Gardening Scheme](https://nationalforestgardening.org), organised and curated by [Hannah Gardinder & Paul Pivcevic](https://nationalforestgardening.org/our-board).

It was great. So good, I’m running it again, tomorrow, _with_ a Zoom chat afterwards for 30 minutes. Bring along your forest garden planning questions!

## Livestream: [twitch.tv/forestgardenwales](https://www.twitch.tv/forestgardenwales)

## Slideshow: [forestgarden.wales/talks/planning](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/planning)

## [Zoom invite](https://us04web.zoom.us/s/77786389692?pwd=S2RST1dBTG54YkhHb3k4K1BLYllSZz09)<br>Meeting ID: 777 8638 9692<br>Password: strawberry

The livestream starts promptly at 10am, the Zoom chat at 10.30am. I’ve only used Zoom a couple of times, so there’s bound to be a Technical Disaster of monumental proportions. Whatever happens, it should be entertaining.
