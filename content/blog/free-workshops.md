Doing my very small bit from a remote hillside in West Wales, I’ve started livestreaming a **free** online workshop on Wednesdays, at 10am. The workshops are free to view on Twitch:

## [twitch.tv/forestgarden.wales](https://www.twitch.tv/forestgarden.wales)

If you want to join in the chat, you’ll need to sign up for a free [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) account.

In case you need to be reassured that I’m not a robot or faceless disaster capitalist corporation, here’s a picture of my face (I’m actually not sure that my face is that reassuring…)

If you would like to contribute towards the costs of running the workshops, you can purchase my [online course](/course) when it’s ready, or you can donate to my PayPal account, which is under my old company name of Grow Digital. The costs aren’t huge, about 4 hours of my time per week plus £10 a month for the extra mobile bandwidth:

Keep safe out there, look after all yourselves and I hope to see you online at some point. Forest gardens for the win!
