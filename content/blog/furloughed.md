Because of coronavirus, we have had to close down the [tours](/tour/) and the [workshops](/workshop/) here at Forest Garden Wales, so my partner hasnâ€™t worked at all this year on this side of the business. Understandably, the remote [design](/design/) work has dried up as well, and I finished my last bit of work yesterday.

So, in these straitened times, we have had to furlough ourselves under the UK [Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/work-out-80-of-your-employees-wages-to-claim-through-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme).

I hope you are managing to keep body and soul together. Keep well and keep safe ðŸ’šðŸŒ³ðŸ™‚
