I gave a talk about [The Smaller Forest Garden](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/smaller/) the other day, and only 3 people out of the two dozen strong audience had heard of the [State of Nature report 2019](https://www.bto.org/our-science/publications/state-nature-report/state-nature-report-2019) published October 2019. 

> “State of Nature 2019 documents how human impacts are driving sweeping changes in wildlife in the UK. As well as an overarching assessment of UK flora and fauna, there are separate reports for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales to look at each country in more depth. The reports pool data and expertise from 53 nature conservation and research organisations, a partnership unparalleled in UK conservation.”

**15% of species are under threat of extinction in the UK.**

The report didn’t even make it to the home page of the BBC News website. So, this post is a reference to **[download the report](https://www.bto.org/our-science/publications/state-nature-report/state-nature-report-2019)** from the [British Trust for Ornithology](https://www.bto.org) website.

Spread the word, be informed.
