Today’s Lockdown Livestream went really well (from my perspective at least, no 4 year olds bursting in, announcing their bowel movements to the nation). We also had a Zoom Q&A with about 3-4 participants. This went really well, pleasantly surprised at the usefulness and ease with which people settled in to discussing forest gardens. So, this will be a regular feature from now on, a Zoom Q&A at the end of each Lockdown Livestream. 

Recording and slides are both online:

Unfortunately, the Zoom chat wasn’t saved automatically, so links are from memory:

* Robert runs [Social Orchards](https://www.facebook.com/socialorchards/), “publicly accessible fruit throughout London”, really interesting project, do get involved.
* Russell is thinking about setting up a community forest garden; I posted links to my [Wild Food Corridors](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/wild-food-corridors/) project. This didn’t get off the ground, because I couldn’t get the funding without setting up a [Community Interest Company](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-regulator-of-community-interest-companies), which is not what I want to do right now. FWIW, here’s my [synopsis](https://app.simplenote.com/p/xmnMKl) and [application](http://simp.ly/p/BPMP8t), may be be useful to someone out there.
* Discussion about [Bindweed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolvulus_arvensis) and how to control it. If you can, dig **all* the roots up carefully, without breaking them. If you can’t dig them up, consider using [Roundup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup_(herbicide)). I don’t normally ever advocate herbicides _but_ to make a one-off adjustment, it can work. Use the roll-on gel, don’t spray. Possibly controversial opinion but wildlife gardener Benjamin Vogt has something to say about [using chemicals to remove lawns](https://www.monarchgard.com/thedeepmiddle/diy-garden-bed-prep-the-good-and-the-meh)
* Question about nut yields, and how to improve them. I’ve yet to have a nut harvest here, only having planted the [Sweet Chestnuts](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Castanea+sativa) 3-4 years ago and the [Hazels](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Corylus+avellana). Both Rob and I recommended [Fruit and Nut](http://fruitandnut.ie/contact.html) over in County Mayo in Ireland. Also, [Future Forests](https://futureforests.ie), also in Ireland, were mentioned as a nursery. I’ve had great hedging plants from them.

A very big thank you to all who took part, particularly Pam, Russell, Robert and Peter 🙏🌳🙂
