Traditional agricultural science can’t cope with complexity of forest garden, 100+ species of plants.

Science & complex systems (thinking of chaos theory)

## Energy efficiency

Forest Garden 1:40 Arable 1: 4 Animal 1: 0.8

Yield **and** input

## Ideas

* Berberis as windbreak, useful for easterly protection
* Bowles Hybrid willow, 1.2m wide, non-competitive roots, vestigiate
* People space where paths converge
* Batboxes in trees

### Coppice

* Sweet chestnuts coppice crop 6 years for fence posts - last 10-15 years
* Hazels
* Redwoods for fenceposts

> If you forecast the future, you will be doomed to fail

## Spacing

* Tree spacing ¼ – ½ of combined tree diameters
* But, can plant small trees under high trees eg Italian alder
* Windbreak protection is 3 \* the height, eg 2m hedge gives 6m protection
* Cross pollinators 2-3 trees apart
* Nitrogen fixing trees can be 30–40m away
* Ash roots as wide as high (same for poplar). Normally 1/3 of height.

> Many small errors multiply and lead to great unhappiness

# Out in the garden

* Toona sinensis - pollard every winter
* Tilia cordata - pollard every 3-4 years
* White mulberry - leaf crop cooked, high in protein
* Cornus kousa - 25m in 20 years
* Valerian - potassium accelerator cut for onsite mulch
* Plum yew - ripe in November
* Phyllostachys
  * shade tolerant
  * can grow 25cm per day!
  * can spread 2-3m per year
  * maintenance 1-2 times per year
  * 5m high, 2cm canes
  * 80 canes
  * 120 shoots
  * 10 shoots per meal
* Pear, medlar, hawthorn can graft on existing hawthorn
* Crataegus ellwegariana - tarpaulin on ground, shake branches
* Black locust for timber 20-30 years

## Most attractive fruit colours to birds

In descending order:

* Purple
* Red
* Orange
* Black (mulberries)

---

* Cornus capitata - edible fruit 3.5-4cm end Nov, banana flavour
* Zanthoxylum schinifolium - leaves for flavouring in spring
* Pineapple guava
* Sweet chestnut Marigoule, early ripening 30-35kg. Harvest with tarpaulin, frequently especially if windy. Knock the branches.
* Syrian hawthorn, thornless, delicious raw
* European bladdernut - shade tolerant, understorey, pistachio flavour nuts, 1cm
* Bog myrtle - N-fixer, armoatic leaves, insect repellent, lovely
* Tibetan whitebeam - fruits 2cm like marzipan
* Bamboo for playground
* Shrubby alders for extra N, lie prunings flat
* Zanthoxylum alatum Nepalese pepper, fragrance like black pepper
* Compost toilet in tent
* Swamp cypress, v. tolerant of damp, hard wood, coppice for fence posts

## Outside again, Saturday afternoon

> Self-seeding only happens in context

* Ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea), aromatic, good cover, good bee plant
* Japanese & Chinese yam, hardy in UK, raosted
* Turkish rocket, cooked. Evergreen in UK
* Ostrich fern - for shrubbery late March
* Lemon balm, mint, oregano, possibly anti-bacterial, anti-fungal
* Japanese butterbur (Petasites japonicus)- damp shade
* Solomons Seal, Polyganatum biflorum - damp shade
* Let raspberries move
* Turkish rhubarb (Rheum palmatum) - fairly shade tolerant
* Gunnera - N-fixing, in leaf stalks by algae
* Sweet cicely - perennial: leaf, seed and root crop
* Hops for shoots
* Nepalese raspberry - shade, fanatastic ground cover for woodland

> Maintenance: 1 day per week for 2 acre garden over the year. Efficient.

* Most perennials 1-5 months germination!
* Purslane - bettroot flavoured, shde, self-seeding
* Pulmonaria - bee plant & accumulator

* Hop
  * Grow up lower branches of Italian alder
  * 1 plant provides 100g dried hops, enough for 50 litres beer
  * 3-4 shoots going up, Apr-Jul/Aug - for the rest, harvest the hop shoots
* Meadowseet - lovely feathery cream flowers, 2m, bee plant
* Babbingtons leek
  * harvest as leek, cut shot
  * distribute bulbils by broadcast in light groundcover
  * garlicky flavour
* Korean raspberry good for shade under treas

### Ground cover techniques

* Mulch strip, moving plants
* 3-10 plants per m²
* Set up mother beds
* Dwarf comfrey, good spreading cover. Don't cut for mulch.
* Periwinkle - flowers all year, good evergreen cover for shade

---

* Swiss mint - type of mint for teas, not particularly spreading
* Tropaeolum tuberosum (Mashua) perennial nasturtium
  * tuber very productive
  * leave in the ground, just harvest what you need, leave tubers to regrow

---

## SUNDAY

* Prof. Martin Wolfe, Organic Research Centre
* Integrated Forest Gardening - worth a read
* Eric Toensmeier 'Edible Forest Gardens' 2 vols, quite academic

### FGN

* Aim to facilitate visits to other members gardens
* About 200, 160 in UK

### Nutrient budgets

* Heavy cropping fruits require extra N, 6-10 g/m² per year
* Rough rule - 2/3 area of heavy cropping plant to be N-fixing plants
* Portable compost toilet
  * Dig hole
  * Use for one season
  * Fill and move
* If pH les than 6.0, then lime

## In the new forest garden

* The Forest Garden Greenhouse by Jerome Osentowski
* Transitional ground cover - trefoil, clover, mustard etc

### Transitional ground cover process

1. Put down chipped bark
2. Plant perennials and long term cover (eg strawberries)
3. Plant temporary cover thickly
4. Strawberry expands

* Plant comfrey around fruit trees!
* All mallows have edible leaves
* Train bramble fruits (thornless) on to Elaeagnus umbellata
* Liquorice, horseradish - eat young leaves in spring
* 400m² (1 acre) enough for family of four

### Sea buckthorn harvesting

* Cut whole fruting branch
* Freezer for 1 hour
* Tap & fruits come off
* Harvest from sides, not upward growth

### Propogation

* Seaweed solution
* 3 days nettle & comfrey feed
* Mulch 6 months for grass, 12 morths for docks & dandelions

### Predator strips

* Senecio (Brachyglottis)
* Meadowsweet
* Sweet cicely

> For land-based work, you have to be efficient

### Harvesting nuts & apples

* Tap the branches with big stick if it hasn't been windy
* Harvest nuts frequently, every 2 days
* Each tree has approx 2 week harvest
* Nut Wizard £60 - can use with chestnuts once free from burr
* Chestnut harvest end September
* Make sure ground cover under nut tree is short or mown eg wild garlic dies back or cut comfrey
* Silky 3.6m telescopic pruning saw
* Nut drying machine 35°C - 1kW heater with fan

#### Preparing chestnuts

* Chestnuts 60% water (cf walnuts), need 50-55°C in shell to dry, 3 days. Shells crack easier when dry.
* Put chestnuts in hessian sack, bash on concrete, skin comes off
* To use dried chestnuts, soak overnight in water
* Cook 40 minutes
* Hawos electric stone mill, designed for grain, will smash nuts

### Mushrooms

* Oyster
* Shitake - easiest
* Fresh logs, no less than 2 months old
* Denser wood preferred
  * Oak - 10-12 years mushrooms
  * Alder - 6 years
* Anne Miller, Scotland, for fungus spawn & food grade wax
* High protein crop
* Store logs somwhere shady and damp
* Chaos funorum for edible fungus inoculant
* Paul Stamets - ideas and books

#### Shocking the Shitake log

* Soak the log overnight
* Bang **hard**
* Keep out of way of slugs
* Buds appear after week
* Rest for 3 months
* Shock every 3 months
* Harvest shitake 7-8cm, quickly
* 1 kilo every 3 months, 30 kilos over 10 years

#### Propogating mycelium

* Put inoculated log into thick plastic sack
* Keep for one year, winter to winter
* Scrape off mycelium, put into holes

### Cleft grafting

* Sloe - graft plums
* Hawthorn - graft medlar, pear
* Buy graft wood from Brogdale
* Cut graftwood in January on dry, sunny day
* Put in fridge for up to 3 months
* In spring, graft in April/May
* Cleft graft easiest
* Straight split, no side branches. Lever with screwdriver
* Graftwood 1cm-70mm
* Leave 2-3 buds
* Line up _inner_ edge of dark bark
* Wax over surface using grafting wax
* Will grow to full width
* As existing tree, will grow vigorously
* Italian grafting pliers available (Brondesbury Garden Centre)

### Apple grafting

* Plant apple rootstock
* Let grow for 2-3 years
* Cut 2cm branch
* Graft wood on

### Kiwi

* Climbing kiwi
* Coppice with tree every 3-4 years
* Grow on South side
