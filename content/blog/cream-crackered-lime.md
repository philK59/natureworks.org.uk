Thereâ€™s a metric tonne of powdered lime in the Dutch Barn that needs to make way for the annual thinning of the 2 acre woodland. This is our main source of wood for the woodburner until the coppice starts producing in a few years time, so we need all the space we can get.

We had our soil tested at the [local farmers coop](http://www.ccfagri.co.uk), and itâ€™s about 5.5pH, so fairly acid by the [reckoning of the RHS](https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=239). [Sprinkling powdered lime](https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=144) (quarried limestone that has been ground) is the easiest way to balance the acidity and you can buy it by the trailer-load from a local quarry.

But crikey, isnâ€™t that powdered lime ever so heavy, particularly when you have to wheelbarrow it up a track and across a bumpy field. And the weather, well, a muggy 12Â°C, meant I ended up working in my T-shirt. In December. Ridiculous. I was proper cream-crackered.
