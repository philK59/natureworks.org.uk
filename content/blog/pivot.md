I gambled on making a living from running forest garden [tours](https://www.forestgarden.wales/tour/) and [workshops](https://www.forestgarden.wales/workshop/), using the [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/users/show/233536194) network to get passing holiday trade. But unfortunately, forest gardening is too niche and West Wales is too far away and I, I am simply Not That Famous (yet). 

It has been great fun (and **8** [five star reviews](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/users/show/233536194) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê üòé) but next year I‚Äôll be limiting it to a couple of forest garden tours per month, still via Airbnb as it‚Äôs very easy to manage.

Instead, I am concentrating on forest garden design, specifically **remote wildlife forest garden design**. The _remote_ part, because it‚Äôs amazing what you can do with 3D maps, satellite photos, Zoom conference calls and video walkarounds. And also because West Wales is sparsely populated and can‚Äôt really support such a specialisation. 

I‚Äôve created a design for some clients in North London, enigmatically called the [Green Room](https://app.simplenote.com/p/JZlZ1N). It has been an absolute blast, using Whatsapp for discussions and [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for video conferencing. The critical thing is to get the tree spacing right; the rest of the garden is in relatively large brush strokes. Here‚Äôs a CAD plan overlaid on a satellite photo:

I have also started sketching in, which is great fun too, and I‚Äôve been experimenting with both pencil and pen sketches, overlaid with colour in Photoshop.

I really like drawing with pencil, because it‚Äôs a good way to get a sense of the 3D space, something that‚Äôs pretty lacking in a CAD package like [QCAD]](https://www.qcad.org). The ink line drawings coloured in are better for diagrammatic type illustrations, such as this rather wonky pond:

I‚Äôm also increasingly interested in the wildlife aspects of forest gardening, having listened to [Benjamin Vogt](https://www.monarchgard.com) with great interest on the [Roots and All podcast](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/podcast-32-a-new-garden-ethic-with-benjamin-vogt/), and read [Kate Bradbury](https://mobile.twitter.com/kate_bradbury)‚Äôs [Wildlife Gardening](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/wildlife-gardening-9781472956057/), a magnificent introduction to two separate worlds combined. 

And although forest gardening is focussed on human edible crops, it is very much on the same path, the idea of building an ecosystem that sustains itself, whilst providing a harvest. And there is **always** room for native plants!

The next step is to re-work the website, putting garden design front and central. And then, next year, online workshops!
