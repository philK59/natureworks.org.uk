The Covid-19 coronavirus crisis shines a light on how ill-prepared and unequal our society has become. Essential workers are amongst the poorest paid workers. And it’s also highlighted the fragility in our food production and distribution, hence the massive increase in popularity of Grow Your Own veg.

**Now** is the time to think about the climate and ecological emergency.

**Now** is also the time to plant a forest garden. You [grow edible crops with nature](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/), so it’s is all about sustainable food production **and** increasing wildlife in your garden. However, like any system, it takes a while to establish. A [Sweet Chestnut](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Castanea+sativa) tree is a good source of staple carbohydrates, and a mature tree can provide a crop of 60kg of nuts. A [Hazel](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Corylus+avellana) can be incredibly productive, with fattier nuts. Perennial vegetables can provide longer season and more nutritious leafy greens and edible flowers. But they all take _time_, more time to establish than annual vegetables. 

The plus side is that they are much lower maintenance, they don’t require watering, feeding or planting out every year. And they are also planted for future generations rather than just this season. 

My advice is, get ready and start your forest garden now.
