A couple of months ago, I went on a [grafting workshop](/blog/grafting-workshop-feb-2019/) run by Steve Wilson and organised by [The People’s Orchard](http://www.stdogmaelsabbey.org.uk/peoplesorchard). I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it, that sense of accomplishment when you create something beautiful and unique (if a little Frankensteinian after I’d hacked them with the grafting knife). 

I grafted two varieties, one is [Ashmead’s Kernel](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples/ashmeads-kernel), a rather delicious eater from the 1700s. The other is **Poppit Persawrus**, as the cutting comes originally from a self-seeded apple tree in [Poppit Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppit_Sands), and [Persawrus](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=cy&tl=en&text=persawrus) is Welsh for aromatic, because the apple tastes rather like bubblegum! 

The good news is that both grafts have taken and are in leaf, the Ashmead’s Kernel a couple of weeks later than the Poppit Persawrus. That is 100% success rate and I am feeling rather chuffed with myself 😏

In the autumn, I’ll plant them out in the [Ornamental Forest Garden](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/introducing-ornamental-maintenance-free-forest-garden/).
