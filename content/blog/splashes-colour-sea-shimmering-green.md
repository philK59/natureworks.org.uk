I like forest gardens, obviously. Although they can be very… _green_. In the midst of this wintry spell here in West Wales, I’ve sown some flowers, pollinator friendly flowers, that will also add a zing of colour to the borders.

I’m buckling down on the perennial vegetable front, inspired by the likes of Alison [@BackyardLarder](https://mobile.twitter.com/backyardlarder) (see her [2019 review](https://backyardlarder.co.uk/2019/03/2019-review/)), Mandy [@IncredibleVeg](https://mobile.twitter.com/IncredibleVeg) and Stephanie [@Steph_Hafferty](https://mobile.twitter.com/Steph_Hafferty), so I planted up a grouping of [sorrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorrel), 3 x Broad-Leaved Sorrel and 3 x 'Blood Veined' Sorrel. I’ve found it’s much more productive to plant in groups rather than individually, otherwise you’re often scrabbling around for enough to harvest.

As you can see from the photo, there’s plenty of room for flowers. The ones I’ve chosen are all easy to grow, a bonus for my clumsy propagation skills, and excellent for beneficial insects:

* Bergamot ([Monarda didyma](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Monarda+didyma))  
  _Perennial, leaves & flowers in salads, make aromatic tea_
* Pot Marigold ([Calendula officinalis](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Calendula+officinalis))  
  _Annual, edible leaves & flowers, dye from petals_
* Borage ([Borago officinalis](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Borago+officinalis))  
  _Annual, amazing bee plant, edible flowers_
* Poached Egg Plant ([Limnanthes douglasii](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Limnanthes+douglasii))  
  _Annual, supereasy to grow, great for bees & hoverflies, will self-sow_
* Marigold 'Naughty Marietta' ([Tagetes patula](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Tagetes+patula))  
  _Annual, classic companion plant for veg plots_

Total cost £7.05GBP, which is a total bargain, and I’ll make sure to collect the seeds for even more colour next year.
