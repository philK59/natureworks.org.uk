The whole idea behind a forest garden is that it works _with_ nature, to be as self-sustaining as possible. This means encouraging as much wildlife as possible so that all the crops are pollinated and all the pests are naturally controlled by predators. So a productive forest garden is, by definition, a wildlife friendly garden.

I had a huge amount of fun choosing my top ten bee & pollinator friendly plants. The trees (canopy layer) have been planted, and I‚Äôm most of the way through the planting the ground cover. Now I‚Äôm thinking hard about shrubs and system plants (these are plants that aren‚Äôt harvested for a direct crop but which provide great benefit for the garden as a whole). Now is the time for **colour**, for the bees _and_ me!

The criteria for choosing the plants are threefold:

1. They provide nectar _and_ pollen
2. They have a long flowering period
3. I like the look of them

That last one isn‚Äôt so scientific. So, in no particular order, with the common name, flowering period and photo:
