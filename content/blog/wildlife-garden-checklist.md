Inspired by [Malcolm Berry](https://www.facebook.com/The-Dreaded-Gardener-1403035606578314/)’s wildlife gardening talk to [Drefach Gardening Club](http://www.drefachfelindregardeningclub.co.uk), here is a simple list of features that benefit wildlife in any garden.

1. **Pond:** The number one must-have feature, water is essential for life. It doesn’t have to be big, it doesn’t have to be posh. For ideas, information and inspiration, look at [Freshwater Habitats Trust](https://freshwaterhabitats.org.uk), particularly their [Advice Centre](https://freshwaterhabitats.org.uk/pond-clinic/). I’m looking to use clay to line our new pond, as I want to cut down on the use of plastic.
* **Meadow:** Even a small patch of meadow and wildflowers can create so much habitat for all manner of pollinators, predators, mammals, birds etc. I went to see Matt and Vicky at [Wyndrush Wild Meadows](http://wyndrushwild.co.uk) (that’s one of their wildlife ponds pictured above) and the diversity was fascinating. I have a small “makeshift meadow” in the forest garden, which I scythe once a year to create hay mulch. Malcolm recommended scything just ⅓ of the meadow each year for maximum wildlife.
* **Hedges:** An unkempt hedge is the ultimate in protection, habitat and food source. Apart from a pond, maybe. Make sure you choose a hedging plant that grows to the desired height and width, to reduce the amount of maintenance. And choose a mixed hedge if you can, with native plants in. For example, [hawthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+monogyna) ([Kate Bradbury](https://mobile.twitter.com/Kate_Bradbury)’s top wildlife plant) can grow to 8 metres tall, whereas the absolutely gorgeous native [Guelder Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus) grows to 5 metres. Also, grow some evergreen hedges for year round cover. [Elaeganus x ebbingei](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+x+ebbingei) gives you late spring fruit as well, and being evergreen is easy to manage as its growth is slower.
* **Mature trees & shrubs:** Well, grow a full fledged forest garden! Any tree is brilliant. If you have a smaller garden, you can choose a [small rootstock](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/rootstock-reference/) on a fruit tree, or a tree in a big pot, or smaller species, like the [Chinquapin](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Castanea+pumila) instead of the [Sweet Chestnut](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Castanea+sativa). As for shrubs, I have a soft spot for [juneberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelanchier) and [barberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berberis), with plenty of species and cultivars to choose from.
* **Log piles:** So easy to do, put some logs in a pile. If you have a neat garden, you can tuck your logs out of sight, they’ll still do a great job of providing habitat for a multitude of inverterbrates and amphibians and a food source for everyone.
* **Stone piles:** The same idea as log piles, put some stones in a pile. Provides a different, less slimy habitat. If you put your stone pile in the sun, you may even see some basking lizards.
* **Stone walls:** Slightly more involved than a stone pile, but the same idea. Also, a great location for the strangely fashionable (and edible leaved) [Wall Pennywort](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Umbilicus+rupestris).
* **Flowers:** Yep, flowers **all year round** for pollinators and predators. Include some umbellifers for our smaller tongued compatriots. There is a wealth of information online about suitable flowers. Martin Crawford’s book [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) has a whole appendix devoted to which flowers provide pollen and/or nectar and when.
