Someone on [@GdnBloggers](https://twitter.com/Gdnbloggers) recommended [Ruth Stout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Stout)’s [No Work Garden Book](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ruth+stout+no+work+garden+book&t=osx&ia=products), and it has been a true delight, full of little mulching nuggets of practical wisdom. I picked the book up for about £3.20 incl. postage from [World of Books](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/category/all?keyword=ruth%20stout) but <abbr title="Your Mileage May Vary">YMMV</abbr>, as it’s currently selling for £202.58. Pick up an affordable copy when you can.

The essence of the book, an ironically ground-breaking no-dig classic, is **mulch everything**, with whatever you have to hand. She often uses a hay mulch, which is something [Charles Dowding](https://www.charlesdowding.co.uk) advises against because it can encourage slugs in a damp, UK climate. But as it’s the only mulching material I have at the moment, it will do for now.

To be honest, there’s only certain plants that need protection from slugs, mostly young beans and squashes & courgettes. I’ll mulch these with garden compost when the plants are young, then switch to a hay mulch from the Makeshift Meadow.
