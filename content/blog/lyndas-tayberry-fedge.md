At the end of my [Introduction to Forest Gardening talk](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/ldgc/) at [Llechryd Gardening Club](https://www.facebook.com/LlechrydDGC/), the Club Secretary Lynda kindly offered some [Tayberry](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=4923) bushes, suggesting that they would grow well on the south side of the dead hedge.

I have previously waxed lyrical about the [benefits of a dead hedge](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/dead-hedging-forest-garden/): it provides shelter for weakly plants, uses up material from cutting a hedge and provides for wildlife. Now I discovered that it can be a support for climbing plants! Fantastic, there seems to be no end to the joy a dead hedge can bring.

I was planning on planting some thornless [blackberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+fruticosus) but the [Tayberry](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=4923) (a cross between a blackberry and a raspberry) is ideal as well, the ones Lynda has donated are a) thornless and b) free!

You can also plant thornless ramblin’ Rubus up the south side of a windbreak hedge, just as Lynda has done with hers in the photo above. My favourite hedge to do this with is [Juneberry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Amelanchier+canadensis) and [Guelder Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus), as they’re both on the same thornless tip, makin’ pickin’ easier.
