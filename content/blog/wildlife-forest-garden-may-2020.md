My next free lockdown forest garden livestream is: 

## The Wildlife Forest Garden

## Wednesday 6th May, 10am BST

### [twitch.tv/forestgardenwales](https://www.twitch.com/forestgardenwales)
<br>
Iâ€™ll be looking at why forest gardens are so good for wildlife, the importance of native plants, easy wildlife features for your garden, plus a short walk outside.

Also, [Sarah Wilson](https://twitter.com/swilson09)â€™s, who creates the [Roots and All podcast](https://rootsandall.co.uk/thepodcast/), has very kindly made an **exclusive video** for me to air, giving a 10 minute tour of her wildlife garden. Sheâ€™s a real inspiration, do give her podcast a listen, thereâ€™s [lots of previous episodes](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/roots-and-all/).

Look forward to you seeing me (if that makes sense, this Twitch livestreaming is a bit one way!). There will also be a recording on my [YouTube Channel](youtube.com/channel/UCKXKUlYUniJwEy1Lkvs78qw). Please subscribe to my channel because then I get to give it a proper name rather than `UCKXKUlYUniJwEy1Lkvs78qw` ðŸ™‚

Keep safe, keep well, keep fighting âœŠðŸŒ³ðŸ’š
