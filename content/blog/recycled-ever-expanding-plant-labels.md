I used to tie ordinary plants to tree branches with bits of baling twine. But theyâ€™re ugly, flap about and donâ€™t expand with the thickening branch.

So, I cut up long strips of old plastic milk bottles, stuck a label printed out from my [labelling machine](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Brother-PT-H110-Labeller-Keyboard-Handheld/dp/B01N5ID8FR/) and then curled the plastic like you would a [present ribbon with scissors](https://www.wikihow.com/Curl-Ribbon).

Members of my family poke fun at me for having a dedicated plant labeller but the labels last indefinitely, unlike permanent (sic) ink or pencil. 

Iâ€™ve tried this method out on a Victoria Plum, and the label has kept its shape for a good couple of years now ðŸ™‚.
