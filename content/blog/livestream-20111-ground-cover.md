## Spreadsheets, gallery & CAD files

Following on from last weekâ€™s livestream, Iâ€™m still working with other forest garden folk to create a spreadsheet of all forest garden plants mentioned in Martin Crawfordâ€™s book [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/). Until thatâ€™s ready, here are some other links:

1. First up, I made some spreadsheets using tables from Plants For A Future, for hedging and ground cover plants, which you may find useful.
2. There is a Forest Garden Gallery [forestgardengallery.uk](https://forestgardengallery.uk/) created by members of the Forest Garden WhatsApp group â€” itâ€™s early days but slowly evolving in exciting ways.
3. And for those people using CAD, Iâ€™ve started creating a set of different CAD symbols that can be copied and pasted into your drawing. The GitHub repository is here, though very much a work in progress [github.com/growdigital/forest-garden-cad](https://github.com/growdigital/forest-garden-cad/)

## [Permaculturist Graham Burnett on Roots & All](https://rootsandall.co.uk/portfolio-item/episode-84-permaculture-with-graham-burnett/)

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1604926022/phillip-larking-roots-and-all-leaf.jpg" alt="Red veined leaf" >}}

On my [favourite gardening podcast](https://rootsandall.co.uk/thepodcast/), [Graham](https://spiralseed.co.uk/) is a prominent vegan permaculture practitioner and advocate. I remember a rather vitriolic reaction to his using the term vegan permaculture on that there Facebook. What a surprise, vitriol on Facebook ðŸ™„ Note: you can have animals in an ecosystem without eating them.
