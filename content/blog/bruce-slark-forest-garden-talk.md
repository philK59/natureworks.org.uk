Bruce’s talk on his well-established forest garden at [Moylgrove Hall](https://www.moylgrove.wales/events) was very interesting, particularly because it _is_ well-established. Here at Forest Garden Wales, the fruit trees on a windy hillside are only just starting to bear fruit, so it was great to see a full complement of produce on display.

The other point that hit home is the health aspect. [Robert Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hart_%28horticulturist%29), a pioneer of temperate forest gardens and author of [Forest Gardening](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Forest-Gardening-Robert-Hart/dp/1900322021), apparently had an 80% raw food vegan diet.

Here are my random notes from the evening, really for my benefit but you’re welcome to peruse if you want:

* Netting, essential for fruit trees and fruit bushes. Apples too?!
* Camassia, starchy potato alternative, staple food of Native Americans.
* Put large stone by raised beds for [Song Thrush to use as “stone anvil” for snails](https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/birds/do-birds-other-than-song-thrushes-break-snail-shells-on-stones/).
* Scarlet Hawthorn, fruit on display. [Crataegus ellwangeriana](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+ellwangeriana) or [Crataegus pedicellata](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+pedicellata)?
* Mark bamboo with pen for each year, when 3 years old (3 dots), cane is [lignified](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/lignify) & can be used outside.
* Sweet Chestnuts 14 years old, **30kg nuts from each tree**
* [Cornelian Cherry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Cornus+mas), naturalised in Britain
* [Judas Tree](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Cercis+siliquastrum), edible flowers, nitrogen fixer 
* [Trazel](https://www.frankpmatthews.com/catalogue/trazel), cross between [Turkish Hazel](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Corylus+colurna) and [native Hazel](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Corylus+avellana)
* [Nanking Cherry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+tomentosa), first flowering bush in spring, beautiful
* [Gaultheria shallon](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Gaultheria+shallon), grows well in shade, make tea from leaves like green tea, evergreen
* Aside: is there any such thing as a 90% vegan diet?
