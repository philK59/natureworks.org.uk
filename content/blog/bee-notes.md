## Reasons for Biological Recording

* Reliable biological data
* Conservation - knowing what is there
* Monitoring populations
* Planning land use
* Provides data for academic research

3 paths: 

1. County recorders
2. Local Records Centres LERC
3. National recording schemes eg MCS

* West Wales Biodiversity Information Centre, WWBIC, Whitland
* National Plant Monitoring Scheme
* Bees, Wasps & Ants Recording Centre

## Biological record

1. Who: recorder - full details
2. What: species - backup ID with photo
3. Where: location - 6 figure grid reference
4. When: date - time stamp

> our farmland is not biodiverse at all

Are there specific plants that help with biodiversity? Trees. Species?

Question: what are the most beneficial species for biodiversity? Do they have to be native?

## Bees

> I did a four day course on bumblebees and I was hooked

World: 

1. 25,000 species solitary bee
2. 250 species bumblebee
