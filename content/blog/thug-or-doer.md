Some plants in the garden if left to their own devices will just take over, bramble ([Rubus fruticosus](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+fruticosus)) being an excellent example. The bramble pictured was dug up from what will be the Northern Hedge in the [Ornamental Forest Garden](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/introducing-ornamental-maintenance-free-forest-garden/). (I know, bramble is a fantastic wildlife plant but it’s in the way of the hedge and will be replaced with a thornless variety!)

The question is, at one point does the low-maintenance, self-sufficient, drought-tolerant get-on-with-it-and-grow plant turn into a garden thug that crowds out all competition?

The whole point of a forest garden is that it _is_ low maintenance, that plants can just get on with it and don’t need any special attention once they’re established. When Pat Causton from the [National Garden Scheme](https://www.ngs.org.uk) came to visit, she said about my [False Ivy](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Glechoma+hederacea) (Glechoma hederacea) ground cover “But that’s a weed!”. 

And she’s right. But. It depends on what you’re doing.

[Marietta O’Byrne](https://northwestgardennursery.com) wrote the book [A Tapestry Garden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35489114-a-tapestry-garden) and in [conversation with Margaret Roach](https://awaytogarden.com/underplanting-making-a-tapestry-garden-with-marietta-obyrne/) talks about plants that are amenable to move, with an [easy root system](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/90876/i-Lamium-maculatum-i-White-Nancy/Details). The forest garden stalwart [Vinca minor](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Vinca+minor) is **not** one of those plants. “Once you have vinca, deep-rooted, you’ve got it. You want to get rid of it? You never will.”

You also have to think about **where you are**. For example, [Purple Loosestrife](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Lythrum+salicaria) (Lythrum salicaria) is a [fantastic pollinator plant](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/top-10-bee-friendly-plants/) native to the UK. But [Ken Druse](https://kendruse.com) in his book [The Passion for Gardening](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/940298.Ken_Druse) is writing about the US: “wherever _Lythrum salicaria_ is on the loose, native plants can’t keep a foothold”.

Again, it depends.

So, watch out for invasive plants and be sure that you can contain a vigorous plant, such as a mint or a [running bamboo](https://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/grow-plants/types-of-bamboo-to-grow/). Apart from that, I think there is a lot of sucking and seeing on this gardening journey, which is what Wade Muggleton describes in a lovely post [What Crops to Grow & What to Cull](https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/what-crops-grow-what-cull) (spoiler: the Goji Berry got the chop).
