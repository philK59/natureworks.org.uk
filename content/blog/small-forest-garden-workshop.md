Thanks to everyone who turned up for the free online forest garden workshop ðŸ˜€

This week, I was talking about The Small Forest Garden. We covered forest garden principles and how to apply them to a smaller space, plus some small garden design examples, choosing plants for a small forest garden and me outside, creating a Mini-Forest Garden in a tub.

The recording of the outdoor part stopped after a minute, so I re-recorded it for your delectation. Donâ€™t forget, next week will be another free online forest garden workshop, email me if you have a suggestion of what youâ€™d like covered.
