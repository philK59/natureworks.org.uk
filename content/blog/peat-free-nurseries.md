Using peat-based compost [contributes to #ClimateBreakdown and wildlife habitat loss](https://www.peatfree.org.uk). Best thing you can do is use a peat-free compost (such as Sylvagrow, FertileFibre, Dalefoot etc) **and** buy your plants from a nursery that use peat-free compost.

Nic Wilson [@dogwooddays_nic](https://mobile.twitter.com/dogwooddays_nic) has put together a list of peat-free nurseries here:
