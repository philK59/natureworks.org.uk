I‚Äôm a latecomer to the gardening party and I sometimes feel like a gatecrasher, inadvertently swept in on the coat-tails of [forest gardening](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/about-agroforestry/forest-gardening/) (you know, the scruffy one with the wild look in its eye). So my list of inspirational women is more about the _inspiration_ to explore forest gardening rather than the horticulture per se. But I still want to say thank you üôÇ

* **Nia Higgins & Sophie Jenkins**  
Nia and Sophie run [The Peoples‚Äô Orchard](https://www.facebook.com/peoplesorchardstdogs/), a local Pembrokeshire project that promotes biodiversity to encourage pollinators. They gave me my first break in presenting a forest garden talk and their group were the first visitors to [Forest Garden Wales](https://www.forestgarden.wales/tours/). This is in addition to putting on planting and pruning workshops. Thank you Nia and Sophie.
* **June Williams**  
June is a mighty force of inspiration and positivity, a gardener and permaculturalist. She helps organise the [Permaculture Tywi](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PermacultureTywi/) [@PermaTywi](https://mobile.twitter.com/permatywi) group in Carmarthenshire. They were my first paying guests to tour the forest garden and the reason why I now have the confidence to offer [workshops](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/experiences/524767) and [tours](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/experiences/532342). Thank you June.
* **Sara Venn & Lou Nicholls**  
Not only are Sara [@Saralimback](https://mobile.twitter.com/Saralimback) and Lou [@loujnicholls](https://mobile.twitter.com/loujnicholls) **proper** gardeners, the kind I aspire to be, they are also moderators on the [#gdnbloggers Twitter chat](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%23gdnbloggers&src=tyah&f=live) and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gdnbloggers/). This is a fantastic community for any gardener who blogs. They‚Äôre prolific on that there social media, raising spirits, asking questions and making connections. Thank you Sara and Lou.
* **Margaret Roach**  
[@margaretroach](https://twitter.com/margaretroach) has been hosting the [A Way to Garden](https://awaytogarden.com/category/etcetera/radio-podcasts/) podcast for like, forever. It has been a delight to listen in a Netflix-style back-to-back binge to all the available podcasts and bathe in  that ocean of expertise. Hopefully some learning has seeped in! Thank you Margaret.
