* Sat 20th & Sun 21st June - design

* See dates below
* 4 hours per session plus half hour break

Imagine your garden looking as lovely as a woodland edge. Imagine that on top of looking wonderfully wild, it produces an abundance of nutrient dense food and will ultimately need very little digging, weeding, manual watering or pest control - all in harmony with animals and other beings (eco friendly and vegan). This is ‚Äòan edible forest garden‚Äô.

Forest gardening is a way of growing food where nature does most of the work for you. Modelled on natural woodland, crops are grown in different layers from high and medium sized canopy to roots, ground cover and climbers. And its not just food and medicine you will get from the forest garden, there are many more yields.

Through careful planning plants are chosen which have beneficial effects on each other, attract beneficial insects and create a healthy biodiverse rich system that maintains its own fertility. Once established, your main task will be harvesting!

## What to expect

This workshop is in 2 parts, the first part will give you the tools you need to design your own forest garden.

The second part will give you an opportunity to design your own place with the help of others. You will also learn how to implement your designs.
