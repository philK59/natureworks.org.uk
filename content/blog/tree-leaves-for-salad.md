I love the [Edimentals & Perennial Vegetables](https://www.facebook.com/groups/273637002647408/) group. Facebook profits from division and disinformation but this group is one of the few plus points, a veritable silver lining. 

I have one [pollarded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollarding) [White Mulberry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Morus+alba) (Morus alba) and two [Small Leaved Limes](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Tilia+cordata) (Tilia cordata) in the forest garden. You can eat the delicate new leaves in a salad. However, I donâ€™t get that much of a crop from the Lime trees, so I asked on the group if pruning throughout the growing season would help increase the crop of young leaves. The answers were mixed and interesting

* Do some research online to see if constant pruning would damage the tree
* Itâ€™s best as a spring crop
* Give it a go and report back
* Make sure to feed it nitrogen, either with a nitrogen-rich mulch or with a [nitrogen fixing plant](https://pfaf.org/user/cmspage.aspx?pageid=346) nearby
* Rotate them for cropping, to prevent tree getting exhausted

I also learned that [American Basswood](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Tilia+americana) (Tilia americana) can be used in the same way but has much bigger leaves. So, I might have to buy yet another tree! 

Thank you everyone for your suggestions ðŸ™‚
