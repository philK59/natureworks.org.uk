Benjamin Vogt’s [@BRVogt](https://mobile.twitter.com/BRVogt) article [
Native Plants, Racism, & the Colonizing Nature of Garden Language](https://www.monarchgard.com/thedeepmiddle/native-plants-racism-the-colonizing-nature-of-garden-language) is thought provoking stuff.

> when we learn the names of fauna in our gardens – spider, beetle, bee, and wasp – we learn their life cycles and what they need to thrive

This idea of wildlife gardening for everyone and everything is the title of [@Kate_Bradbury](https://mobile.twitter.com/Kate_Bradbury)’s excellent [book](https://www.nhbs.com/wildlife-gardening-for-everyone-and-everything-book?bkfno=244291). It pulls the focus back, away from a narrow human aesthetic and toward a [new garden ethic](https://newsociety.com/Books/N/A-New-Garden-Ethic).

To this end, I am going to start cataloguing the creatures I come by and I will start to learn their names. It’s going to be a bit painful as I have panoramic blindspots in the natural world but I shall persevere and honestly, it will be more for my benefit than anyone else.

I do think it’s an interesting use of language, a liberating use rather than one of containment. As Vogt [puts it so eloquently](https://www.monarchgard.com/thedeepmiddle/native-plants-racism-the-colonizing-nature-of-garden-language)

> naming is considered a classic act of ownership in environmental philosophy, in this case naming may be a gateway to equality

## On with the animals

In order of appearance in just a few hours gardening. I will fill in the names at a later date!

I also saw: 

* Short legged daddy long legs
* Medium-small spider with stripes along abdomen
* Crow
* Jackdaw
* Wood pigeon
* Seagull

So, my next step is to find their full names, and then find out what they eat, where they nest, what their babies eat. To help me with that task, there is the excellent UK [Database of Insects and their Food Plants](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/homepage.aspx).
