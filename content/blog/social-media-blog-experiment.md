I have a love/hate relationship with social media. On the one hand, it has opened up completely new gardening and wildlife worlds, via groups such as [#GdnBloggers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/gdnbloggers/?ref=bookmarks). On the other, it has aided & abetted Donald Trump and Brexit.

But forest garden courses and design services don’t promote themselves, so I have taken to _bulk auto-scheduling my blog posts_. This simply means that I write a single blog post once a week, then using a 3rd party service, I schedule multiple social media posts at predefined times linking to the original article.

The service I use is called [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) (together with [Bulk Buffer](https://www.bulkbuffer.com/app)). It costs about £12 per month, which is fairly pricey, though considering that most of my work comes from my website, it’s a reasonable cost. There are similar services such as [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com), [Crowdfire](https://www.crowdfireapp.com), [Stacker](https://www.getstacker.com) and [dlvr.it](https://dlvrit.com).

I found out such things existed after going on a free [Business Wales social media workshop](https://wales.business-events.org.uk/en/events/superfast-business-wales-sell-more-with-social-media/), ably run by Angus from [Web Adept](https://webadeptuk.com). 

The other key takeaway from the workshop was to host all your blog content on your own website and then **syndicate** to your social media platforms. This way, you keep control of your content. Otherwise, the social media platform can simply change it’s terms & conditions, and you won’t be able to access your content any more. This happened to me with Flickr – I have over 2,000 photos on the service, and they recently announced they were [limiting their free service](http://blog.flickr.net/en/2018/11/01/changing-flickr-free-accounts-1000-photos/).

This way of controlling your content is called [Publish Once, Syndicate Site Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), and the good news is that it’s easy to do with [hosted WordPress.com sites](https://en.support.wordpress.com/connect/) and fairly easy to do with self-hosted WordPress sites using eg [Social Network Auto-Poster](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-networks-auto-poster-facebook-twitter-g/). For my bespoke website, I use a free service called [IFTT](https://ifttt.com/).

**But…** I do have misgivings, whether people might see it as some sort of spamming. Personally, I like to get reminders from people that I follow, particularly because of the linear, time-based nature of social media posts. Maybe some people will find it irritating. This is the nature of the experiment!
