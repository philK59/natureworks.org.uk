A neighbour has very kindly lent us a brush cutter, so I’ve been busy for the past couple of weeks clearing the bramble from the coppice area (pictured above) to plant more trees, and the 2 acre sloping pasture so that we can create a wildflower meadow.

Too often, even in forest gardening, the first thought is “what’s in it for me?”. It’s a luxury to be able to spend time creating a habitat for wild flowers and wild pollinators. There will be hay, lots of hay, and I will use that for mulching and for composting. 

I would also like to plant some specimen trees amongst the wild flower meadow, so that’s some sort of yield.

This year, it’s all about clearing the bramble ([Rubus fruticosus](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+fruticosus)). In this part of the world, it is _everywhere_. As bad vegans, and with bad fencing, we don’t have the neighbour’s cattle on the land any more. You can really notice the rapid spread in just two years. This is [ecological succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_succession) in action. Already, oaks, ash and cherry saplings have sprouted up amidst the thickest bramble bushes. 

A lot of people say to use [glysophate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphosate) to kill the bramble roots. Well, I’m not a big fan of herbicides. So, we’re going to try a [flame gun](http://www.sheenflamegun.co.uk/index.htm) (and probably a bit of digging). That’ll be enough for this year, I’ll let you know how it <goes class=""></goes>

Next year, we’ll make a start on clearing the grass.
