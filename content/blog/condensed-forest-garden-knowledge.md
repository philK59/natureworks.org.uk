I happened to be passing [Farmyard Nurseries](https://farmyardnurseries.co.uk) (where I accidentally bought some [Mentha longifolia](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Mentha+longifolia)) and met someone who wants to start a forest garden. They wanted some quick advice, time was limited so I wrote this list:

1. Buy **[Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/)** by Martin Crawford. Fantastic design manual and reference.
2. Use [Plants for a Future](https://pfaf.org/) website for quick reference of species and sizes.
3. **Plan** your [canopy layer](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/seven-layers-forest-garden/), to allow enough light for fruiting trees and underplanted crops (about Â¼ to Â½ of combined tree diameters).
4. **Windbreak hedges** to the final size you want (less maintenance pruning), dramatically improves growth of developing plants.
5. Use the [Sun Surveyor](https://www.sunsurveyor.com) mobile app to check the sun positions on your plan for different times of the year.  

Once youâ€™ve done all that, [book a 1 day workshop](https://www.forestgarden.wales/workshop/) in West Wales ðŸ˜‰
