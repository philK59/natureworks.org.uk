After the incredibly positive and encouraging feedback from [The People’s Orchard](http://www.stdogmaelsabbey.org.uk/peoplesorchard) and Permaculture Tywi, we’ve decided to offer a half-day tour and talk of our forest garden in Ceredigion.

Concerns that the garden isn’t established enough proved to be misfounded: the feedback we had was that a newly-established forest garden is in many ways an advantage for those wanting to find out about forest gardening. People can **see** the structure and planting of the land far more clearly. 

As we plan is to create the Ornamental Maintenance-free Forest Garden (OMG!), there will be plenty of barebones structure for visitors to learn from for quite a while yet!
