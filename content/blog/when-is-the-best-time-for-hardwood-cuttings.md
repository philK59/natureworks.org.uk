The best time for hardwood cuttings is from mid-autumn until late winter. Kind of round about now. 

There are detailed instructions at [RHS Cuttings: hardwood](https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=387) and a video of [@CarolKlein](https://twitter.com/CarolKlein) on [Gardeners‚Äô World.com](https://www.gardenersworld.com/how-to/grow-plants/how-to-take-hardwood-cuttings-in-autumn/). 

What I love about hardwood cuttings is that they‚Äôre so _easy_ ‚Äî yes, you can dig a trench, line with grit and backfill with compost enriched soil. Or, if you‚Äôre not fussed about survival rates, you can put a stick in the ground.

The only provisos for this slapdash approach are: 

1. Make sure the ground is clear of grass
2. Keep it mulched, to retain moisture and keep down competition

I didn‚Äôt follow my own advice and this is what happened:

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1543516107/cornus-sericea-rough-propagation-7C02CF36.jpg" alt="Red twigs in grass" caption="Red Dogwood cuttings somewhat swamped by grass" >}}

Also, I neglected to water the cuttings throughout the drought this summer, and there were about 80% casualties. But considering it took me 10 minutes to ‚Äúplant‚Äù the cuttings, it was a good return.

As much for the benefit of my forgetful mind as for you, the dear reader, here‚Äôs a list of plants for this seaon‚Äôs hardwood cuttings:

* [Cornus sericea](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Cornus+sericea) (Red Osier Dogwood)
