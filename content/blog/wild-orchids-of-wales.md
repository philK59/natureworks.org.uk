Great talk by Sue Parker at [Llechryd & District Gardening Club](http://llechrydgardenclub.co.uk). She’s part of [First Nature](https://www.first-nature.com) who publish a whole range of wildlife guides and books, and she’s Publicity Officer for the [Hardy Orchid Society](http://www.hardyorchidsociety.org.uk).

She has written a lovely looking book called [Wild Orchids of Wales](https://www.first-nature.com/books/walesorchids2.php), I have added it to my reading list.

These are my rather random notes from the talk, in no particular order. Lots about where to see particular orchids in Wales.

* “Rye grass is a destroyer of wildlife and particularly of wild flowers”
* Orchids **don’t survive** if dug up and moved to a garden. Sit in Abercych totally stripped 😢
* Nature reserves - see [website](https://www.first-nature.com) for full list
  * 75 National Nature Reserves in Wales
  * As many local Nature Reserves
  * >100 Wildlife Trust sites
  * RSPB sites
* Gallery of UK & Ireland wild orchids on website
* Gymnodenia cnopsea, Chalk Fragrant Orchid, limestone
* Rhinanthus major, Yellow Rattle, top orchid indicator
* Indicators alkaline soil: Chalk Milkwort, Bloody Cranesbill, Oregano, Spring Gentian
* Indicators acid moorland: Bog Asphodel, Common Butterwort, ?
* Anglesey, alkaline, sea shells
  * Alan Waters country Park, The Warren, Anglesey Fens
* Dactylorhiza maculata, Heath Spotted Orchid, likes acid soil
* Minera Quarry, turned into nature reserve (turn the world into a nature reserve…)
* Vicarage Meadows, Small White Orchid, Brecknock Wildlife Trust
* Elan Valley East, Hammerbya palidosa, Bog Orchid
* Oxwich Bay in July, Anacamplis pyramidalis, Pyramidical Orchid, great numbers
* Kensig National Nature Reserve, nr Port Talbot, Liparis loeslii, Fen Orchid, pioneer orchid
* Dyfi National Nature Reserve, Borth (hybrid hotspot)
  * Spiranthes romanzoffiana, Irish Ladies Tresses, extinct now in England, recorded for 1st time ever in Wales, July 2019. The talk of the orchid town!
  * Doesn’t occur in Europe: Wales, Ireland & North America
* Orchid requires fungi to propagate because seed so small it carries no nutrients, needs symbiotic exchange with fungi

After the talk, I managed to talk with Sue’s partner Pat O’Reilly, author of [Fascinated by Fungi](https://www.first-nature.com/books/fungi2.php). Short but very interesting chat about fungi. There’s a totally purple orchid in France that is only found by a certain species of Pine and [Russula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russula) fungi. It doesn’t have any chlorophyll, and parasitises the relationship between the pine and the fungi. Fascinating.
