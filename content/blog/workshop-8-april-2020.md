Just a quick heads-up, the next free online forest garden workshop will be livestreamed from my Twitch channel at 10am BST on Wednesday 8th April. 

## [twitch.tv/forestgardenwales](https://www.twitch.tv/forestgardenwales)

I’ll be looking at designing windbreaks, planting nurse trees and creating dead hedges. I’ll also be looking at suitable plants for the smaller forest garden.

Slideshow will be available soon at:

Hopefully see you there!
