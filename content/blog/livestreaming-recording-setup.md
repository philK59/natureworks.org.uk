With the onset of the Covid-19 lockdown in the UK, I decided to concentrate on remote, online forest garden courses and workshops. To that end, Iâ€™ve created a rudimentary but effective setup. Iâ€™ll give all the geeky technical details to make it easier to compare equipment.

## Workflow

My workflow is pretty simple. I make a slideshow, and then record the slideshow on one screen (screencast) and record myself with the webcam. This is recorded and/or livestreamed. I then edit the video and upload it.

I also make short videos outside, using a mobile phone on a tripod or selfie stick.

## Hardware

* **Laptop**: _9 year old_ ðŸ˜² MacBook Air, 1.7GHz Intel i5 processor, 2GB RAM, 250GB hard disk **Â£400** equivalent
* **2nd monitor**: _invaluable_ for recording & editing; Samsung SyncMaster P2450, 1920x1080 resolution **Â£80** equivalent
* **Webcam**: [Fusion5 Full HD Webcam](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0881BY2MG/) the only one I could get! Much better than built-in webcam. **Â£40**
* **Microphone**: [Marantz Pro MPM1000U USB](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01GHOM67W/), made a huge difference. **Â£50**
* **Mic stand**: [InnoGear](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01NH31CLK/) very handy for getting mic out of the way quickly! **Â£15**
* **Mobile**: used for outdoor livestreaming & video, [Honor10Lite](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HONOR-storage-Camera-Display-Official-Sapphire-Blue/dp/B07L4PVV6Z/) **Â£140** 
* **Lavalier mic**: for outdoor recording, plug into phone **Â£20** equivalent
* **Tripod**: [AmazonBasics 60" lightweight](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AmazonBasics-60-Inch-Lightweight-Tripod-Bag/dp/B005KP473Q/) **Â£25**
* **Lighting**: 3 bright lamps, light from the side and the back!
* **Backdrop**: Length of patterned tablecloth with bamboo **Â£8.99**

## Websites

* **Website**: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with custom built theme **Â£0**
* **Hosting**: [GitHub](github.com/growdigital/forestgarden.wales) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) **Â£0**
* **Image hosting**: [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) 
* **Slideshow**: [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/) simple in-browser, [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)-driven slideshow
* **Aspect calculator**: [Aspect Ratio Calculator](https://andrew.hedges.name/experiments/aspect_ratio/), always work in 16:9 aspect_ratio

I host the slideshows online (eg my [course slideshows](https://www.forestgarden.wales/course/)), using [Remark](https://remarkjs.com/) files on GitHub, served to the Netlify web host. I also host all my images on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), which means I can change the size of the images on-the-fly when creating slideshows. This makes it superfast to write content. To see this in action, here are two different sized images:

This is a bit of a geeky solution, but itâ€™s free and suits me fine as I was a web designer! For non-geeky folk, Iâ€™d recommend [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) set up by a decent web designer, and then expect to pay Â£20 per month web hosting. For slideshows, [look at alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/remark/).

## Media Software

* **Recording & editing**: [Screenflow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) mac-only & expensive **but** records the webcam and the screencast separately, which is invaluable. Check out [alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/screenflow/). **$129**
* **Audio**: [Ocenaudio](https://www.ocenaudio.com/) good workflow, simple interface **Â£0**
* **Graphics**: [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for making title screens **Â£0**, [Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) (mac-only) for bitmap editing. **Â£40**
* **Livestreaming**: [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/), like a mini-TV studio on your computer, amazing! Hooks up with Twitch for livestreaming from your computer. **Â£0**

## Channels

* **Livestreaming**: [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/forestgardenwales), owned by Amazon, another purveyor of corporate surveillance. But, hey, itâ€™s free. **Â£0**
* **Video archive**: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/ForestGardenWales), owned by Google, who are evil and engage in [corporate surveillance](https://www.bbc.co.uk/ideas/videos/surveillance-capitalism-has-led-us-into-a-dystopia/p06p0tdy). But, hey, itâ€™s free. **Â£0**
* **Chat**: [Chatty](https://chatty.github.io/) is a [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) app that lets you use the Twitch chat without having to open a browser window. Speeds things up a bit ðŸ™‚
* **Conference calls**: [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) 40 minute limit on group meetings. I use Zoom for Q&As and interactive workshops.

## Course platform

* **[Teachable](https://teachable.com/)**: just the platform (ie put courses together) _without_ the marketing. Possibly worth it if you have a dedicated audience already, expect to pay about Â£40 per month. 
* **[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)**: platform _and_ marketing. They do have to the ability to sell your courses at discounts. Advantage is, you have less marketing work to do.

I havenâ€™t looked at the pricing too closely but I would imagine Udemy takes a bigger cut, whereas Teachable has a monthly fee.
