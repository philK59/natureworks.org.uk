Jumping on the website and social media bandwagon is difficult if you don’t have the technical experience or the budget. I discussed this with Teresa Filipponi, senior lecturer in Human Nutrition at [University of South Wales](https://www.southwales.ac.uk), at a [permaculture and nutrition event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/permaculture-and-nutrition-in-international-development-tickets-55693953113#) hosted by [Hub Cymru Africa](http://hubcymru.org/) at [Botanic Garden Wales](https://botanicgarden.wales). 

Here’s a handy checklist:

1. The name. Unique, memorable and 15 characters or less.
2. Register the domain name, a .com or .uk. I recommend [Namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/) **approx £6 pa**.
3. Set up email. I recommend [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=11998805) **approx £40 pa**.
3. Register the name on different social networks. The big ones are Facebook, Twitter & Instagram. Check the availability of names with [namecheckr.com](https://www.namecheckr.com). Try to keep the names the same; Twitter has a maximum limit of 15 characters.
4. Choose your blogging platform. To start, I recommend [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/pricing/), the Personal Plan with a custom domain **approx £50 pa** (per user).
5. Create the structure of your website. Keep it as simple as possible (what you do, where you are, who you are).
6. Choose a WordPress theme for your website.
7. [Connect your social media networks](https://en.support.wordpress.com/publicize/). Now, when you create a blog post in WordPress, it will be automatically shared on your networks.
8. The reason to have a website is that people can find and interact with you; the reason for writing blog posts is to share what you discover and increase your visiblity; the reason for your social networks is to connect with others.
9. Later, you can use something like [Buffer](https://buffer.com/pricing) to bulk schedule social media updates linking to that week’s blog post, and then create daily adhoc status updates via WordPress **approx £50 pa**.

Total all-in annual cost: **approx £140**
