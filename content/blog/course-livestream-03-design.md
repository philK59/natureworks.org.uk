Every week on a Wednesday at 10am, I am a livestreaming a free preview of my online forest garden course, as part of my regular Lockdown Livestream. It‚Äôs a bit rough ‚Äòn‚Äô ready but hey, livestreaming. There is lots of good info there for you üôÇ

All videos recorded on my [YouTube Create a Backyard Forest playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3tnDlJcXMk9VLsc_KU0Ovv4spw5X9yIy)
