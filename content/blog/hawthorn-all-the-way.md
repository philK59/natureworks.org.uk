I’m very lucky to be working on a large farm garden in Pembrokeshire. It’s mostly been clearing bramble and nettles from well-established perennial shrubs and a lovely range of aromatic herbs such as [Southernwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_abrotanum) and [oregano](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Origanum+vulgare).

I’ve also started weeding and planting [Hawthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+monogyna) hedges, which are a top wildlife plant: as a habitat protected by thorns, as food source for larval stage of inverterbates, for the early May blossom for pollinators, and for the jewelled red fruit in autumn. One of my favourite plants, you should always have at least one hawthorn if you can.

A lot of the planting is into quite wild areas, so it’s good to use a thick mulch (such as cardboard, bark or woodchip) to give the young hawthorn a chance to get established.

There is a beautiful south-facing stone wall at the back of the garden. I cleared the [ivy](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Hedera+helix) off the wall and felt bad, because it’s a great wildlife plant in its own right (habitat, late flowers, fruit), I endeavoured to create some more wildlife friendly features: the bare stone wall for lizards and a couple of log piles for all sorts of inhabitants.

To get some more wildlife gardening ideas, I can [@Kate_Bradbury](https://mobile.twitter.com/Kate_Bradbury)’s book [Wildlife Gardening: For Everyone and Everything](https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/wildlife-gardening-9781472956057/). It gives a great overview of different species and possible habitats you can create.
