My talk on The Smaller Forest Garden for [Llangwm Gardening Club](http://www.cottageinn-llangwm.co.uk/llangwm_gardening.html) seemed to go down well (slides here: [forestgarden.wales/talks/smaller](https://www.forestgarden.wales/talks/smaller/)). I love sharing forest gardening ideas and perspectives with other people.

What I have found though is that I am increasingly drawn to political and environmental activism, not because Iâ€™m that way inclined (Iâ€™m a staunch non-committed individualist by nature) but because **we are in a Climate Emergency in an age of Mass Extinction**. 

This is really not my opinion, itâ€™s a scientific fact. [Research from 2017](https://climatenewsnetwork.net/warming-exceed-1-5c-limit-2026/) indicates we could exceed the 1.5Â°C limit by 2026. Trust me, we donâ€™t want to go [above 1.5Â°C](https://e360.yale.edu/features/what_would_a_global_warming_increase_15_degree_be_like). In the UK, [15% of species under threat of extinction](https://www.bto.org/sites/default/files/publications/state-of-nature-2019-summary-report-uk.pdf).

**If we donâ€™t change direction, weâ€™ll end up where weâ€™re going.**

But what can I do? Iâ€™m glad you asked in such a rhetorical fashion:

1. Switch to a [plant-based diet](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49238749)
2. [Stop flying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcobuqiSo8I)
3. Vote tactically for a [Green New Deal](https://greennewdealgroup.org)
4. Garden thoughtfully for wildlife

Iâ€™m in the midst of reading [A New Garden Ethic](https://newsociety.com/Books/N/A-New-Garden-Ethic) by [Benjamin Vogt](https://www.monarchgard.com) and itâ€™s a challenging and vital book. If we garden with native plants, we support a wider range of fauna that has co-evolved with the plants, and the garden can become a way to connect with nature, our surroundings, and our selves. 

It is challenging for me, because so many forest garden plants are non-native to the UK (apples, pears, Autumn Olive, Turkish Rocket etc.). **But** there is the space to incorporate native plants more fully into a forest garden with some careful thought. For example, Iâ€™ve recommended native [Common Barberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Berberis+vulgaris) as a hedging plant for a client and Iâ€™ve planted [Teasel](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Dipsacus+fullonum) and Iâ€™m propagating [Guelder Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus) and [Sea Buckthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Hippophae+rhamnoides) for more hedging.

If you need help, the [RHS Plant Finder](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/Search-Form) has a native filter for the UK, and the [Biological Records Centre](https://www.brc.ac.uk) has a [Database of Insects and their Food Plants](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/homepage.aspx), which makes for fascinating reading (Sea Buckthorn is a [host for 34 insects](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/hostsresults.aspx?hostid=2664)!)

So, get out there and garden inclusively, for everyone and everything! ðŸ™‚
