Laura on Facebook asked about plants for a smaller forest garden. Here are some pointers.

For more detail, see [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) pp30, “Plants for small gardens”

* Use [dwarfing roostocks](https://www.forestgarden.wales/rootstock/#semi-dwarf)
* Consider trained fruit trees eg [espalier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espalier)
* Pollarded trees eg [Small-leaved Lime](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Tilia+cordata), bay (can be pruned)
* Smaller trees eg [hawthorns](https://pfaf.org/user/cmspage.aspx?pageid=59), [Pepper trees](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Zanthoxylum+simulans)
* Check sizes of plants [PFAF](https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx) or [RHS](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/Search-Form)
* Fruit bushes
* All perennial veg, and ground covers
