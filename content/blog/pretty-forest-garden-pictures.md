Whilst designing a [small wildlife forest garden](https://app.simplenote.com/p/JZlZ1N) for some clients in London, I was searching for information about the [Teasel](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Dipsacus+fullonum) on the [RHS plant finder](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/Search-Form). I happened to stumble across the seed sale page, and was greeted by a glorious photograph of a feeding [Goldfinch]().

I showed the photo to the client and straightaway they said “I want Teasels!”. 

This really brought home the importance of a good photo. [Benjamin Vogt](https://www.monarchgard.com), author of the vital book [A New Garden Ethic](https://newsociety.com/Books/N/A-New-Garden-Ethic) is doing some pioneering work in native plant gardening in North America, and some of his [photos](https://www.monarchgard.com/portfolio.html) are just gorgeous. Even if I wasn’t aware of the ecosystem benefits of native plants, I would be **sold** on the idea!

I wrote a [blog post recently](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/screenshot-think-native-plants/) about the sheer number of insect species a Common Oak tree supports. I took a screenshot from the amazing [Database of Insects and their Food Plants](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/hosts.aspx) because it blew me away: **247 species of inverterbrate**. I just think that is _so_ cool. But, it’s not a pretty picture!

I think wildlife and forest gardens are _essential_, because the emphasis is on working with nature. They are still quite niche though and my work is to help spread the word about why they are so good. And a huge part of this is conveying the sense and wonder of the forest garden, with pretty picutres if need be. A case in point is the stunning [National Geographic short film](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/video/shorts/1438178883749/) of [Martin Crawford](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk)’s forest garden (374,000 views!).
