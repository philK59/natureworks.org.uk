At first glance, the idea of a Japanese Garden is at odds with a forest garden: clipped cloud hedges, carefully trained trees, layer upon layer of symbolism and meaning. Whereas as a forest garden, well, you just eat everything, don‚Äôt you?

However, I think that at the core of a Japanese Garden is a reverence for nature. A carefully refined representation of the essence of nature, yes, but still a reverence and a [long-standing connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto). And a reverence for nature is what lies at the heart of forest gardening. In the words of [Martin Crawford](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/about_us/), ‚Äúworking with nature to grow edible crops‚Äù, a forest garden is productive for a range of species.

On the day of my visit, the wind had whipped itself into a gale and flung the rain in my face, in time for me to meet senior horticulturist Daryll Little and her assistant Morgan Rowlands. I am _so_ grateful to them both for taking the time to explain the history, design, maintenance and planting of the garden to an ornamental garden rookie.

The garden is called _Sui ou tei_, referring to the national flowers of Wales and Japan, the daffodil and cherry blossom, and it was designed by [Professor Masao Fukuhara](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/4793669/The-making-of-a-Chelsea-Flower-Show-winner.html) for the [RHS Chelsea Flower Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Flower_Show) in 2001 (winning Best of Show), and then moved to the newly opened [National Botanic Garden of Wales](https://botanicgarden.wales). It was [restored in 2017](https://botanicgarden.wales/press/japanese-garden-a-symbol-of-special-bond-with-wales/).

Daryll and Morgan showed me around the different areas of the garden: the intimate Tea Garden leading to the _iori_ (a rustic retreat used for the tea ceremony), the Dry Garden with gravel and stones symbolising water, the _sanzon-seki_ group of three rocks, and the Pond-and-Hill Garden. 

They also went through the different plants, so many ornamentals I‚Äôd never heard of, so that I was scribbling frantic notes with wet fingers on my phone. What was striking was the amount of maintenance required. Clearing the wind-blown leaves from the gravel every morning is a [Sisyphean task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus).

My key plant takeaways were to use evergreens where possible and to match the shapes and intent rather than specific species. I was thinking [Stone Pine](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Pinus+pinea) as a focal tree, evergreen barberry like [Berberis wilsoniae](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Berberis+wilsoniae), [Creeping Juniper](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Juniperus+horizontalis), different evergreen ground covers such as [Nepalese Raspberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+nepalensis) and [Creeping Thyme](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Thymus+serpyllum), and then more architectural (and useful) plants like [New Zealand Flax](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Phormium+tenax) in the foreground and the smaller [Flax Lily](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/91178/Phormium-Sundowner-(v)/Details) in the background.

I‚Äôm designing from the pond back up to the house, so that the pond is the focal point, supported by a backdrop which flows into the landscape and a carefully spaced meandering foreground. One of the key features of the site is a heavy clay soil. There is an issue with compaction _but_ it does mean that a [clay-lined pond](https://www.forestgarden.wales/blog/clay-lined-pond/) is a distinct possibility, with all its associated wildlife advantages.

A lot of the character of the garden will depend on the local stone and indigenous flora but it is joy to work on a project which can bring together the practical functionality of a forest garden with the aesthetic rhythm of a Japanese Garden. A Japanese Forest Garden indeed, thank you Daryll and Morgan üôè
