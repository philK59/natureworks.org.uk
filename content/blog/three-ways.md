description: I worked with a computer technician called Three-Way George. If you asked him how to do something, he’d always reply “Well, there are three ways…”. Likewise, there are (at least) three ways to describe a forest garden.

It’s always handy to have some simple forest garden definitions to hand.

A forest garden is:

1. A wildlife orchard underplanted with edible shrubs and perennial vegetables.
2. A wildlife garden you can eat (the plants, not the wildlife).
3. A carbon [biosequestration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosequestration) process that yields a harvest.

On a totally unrelated note, did you know that if you have 5 fruit or nut trees, then you have an orchard?
