There is a #ClimateEmergency and the rate of change is incredibly fast. To illustrate this, climate scientist [Ed Hawkins](https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins) from [University of Reading](www.met.reading.ac.uk/~ed/) has created a graphical representation of the rate of change, called warming stripes.

He has also created a website called [showyourstripes.info](http://showyourstripes.info) where you can download the graphic for your country. Use the hashtag [#ShowYourStripes](https://twitter.com/search?q=showyourstripes) and help spread awareness.
