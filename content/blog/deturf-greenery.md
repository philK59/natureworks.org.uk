Last week I decided to grow [more greens in a dedicated Greenery area](http://localhost:3000/blog/eat-your-greens-forest-garden-greenery/). Today, the lofty plans came crashing down into muddy grunt work. 

I would much rather use sheet mulch to clear the grassâ€”itâ€™s less back-breaking, thereâ€™s no turf to move, you keep the nutrients on-site, itâ€™s just better all round. But I want to plant the green things in 2019, so that thereâ€™s a decent amount of kale, cabbage and chard for next winter. This means deturfing, in the pouring rain if need be.

In the spirit of [The No-Work Garden](https://amzn.to/2Gwd4vE) by Ruth Stout, which Iâ€™ve just started reading, I have mulched the freshly de-turfed area with old hay from the polytunnel and wood shavings from the sawmill. Basically, whatever I had to hand.

Poor light stopped deturfing, more fun and games tomorrow ðŸ™‚
