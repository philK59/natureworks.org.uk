The aim is to have your forest garden as a [ecosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem), so that it doesn’t rely on any external inputs for fertility, water or pest control.

Fertility is supplied by ‘system plants’, those plants which don’t have a direct harvest but contribute to the garden as a whole.

Different cropping plants have different fertility requirements. To calculate a nutrient budget, ie how many nutrient providing plants are required, see ‘Fertility in forest gardens’, chapter 6 [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) by Martin Crawford.

## A rough guide for [1 acre](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=1+acre+to+hectare):

* A couple of nitrogen fixing trees, like [Italian Alder](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Alnus+cordata), 
* Some nitrogen fixing shrubs in windbreaks, like [Sea Buckthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Hippophae+rhamnoides) or [Autumn Olive](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+umbellata)
* Clumps of [Comfrey](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Symphytum+officinale) around each fruiting tree for [chop ‘n’ drop](https://www.forestgarden.wales/chop-n-drop/) mulching. 
* Lots of privacy for the application of human urine, which contains 5g nitrogen and 7g potassium per pee (on average, YMMV)!

The acidity/alkalinity (pH) of your soil will also have an effect on how readily nutrients are absorbed. I found the easiest and most cost-effective way to have nutrient levels and the pH tested was from my local farmers cooperative, about £5 per sample. It’s a reasonable price because they want to quite literally sell you a metric tonne of fertilisers!
