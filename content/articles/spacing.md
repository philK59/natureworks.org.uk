Itâ€™s important to leave enough space between trees in the canopy layer, so that thereâ€™s enough light coming through to the plants below. Otherwise, youâ€™ll end up with weak and spindly specimens! 

[Martin Crawford](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/about_us/) in [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) recommends a spacing of about Â¼ to Â½ of the average tree canopy diameter (pp149). 

This is amply demonstrated in the illustration what I created.
