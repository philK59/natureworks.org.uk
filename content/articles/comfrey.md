Comfrey is rich in Potassium, and is a fantastic fertiliser for fruiting plants. ['Bocking 14'](https://www.organiccatalogue.com/products/comfrey-bocking-14-plants_mh6390) is a sterile cultivar of [Russian Comfrey](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Symphytum+uplandicum) which is very high in nutrients and doesnâ€™t self-seed. 

There are 4 ways of using comfrey as a fertiliser (see [Garden Organic](https://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/comfrey) for more detail).

1. **[Chop â€˜nâ€™ drop mulch](https://www.forestgarden.wales/chop-n-drop/)**: grow the comfrey near a fruit tree that has high nutrient demands, then a couple of times a year, chop it back and lay it on the ground as a mulch.
2. **Comfrey feed**: Stuff a bucket full of comfrey stalks & leaves, weigh down, cover with water. Leave for 4-6 weeks. Absolutely stinks, strain off liquid, put sludge on compost. No need to dilute before applying.
3. **Concentrated comfrey feed**: two containers, one with holes in bottom. Weigh comfrey down in container with holes, as it decomposes, thick brown liquid collected by other container. Not so stinky. Dilute 10:1 before applying.
4. **Dry comfrey sprinkle**: dry comfrey leaves in a hot, dry place (eg polytunnel). Skrunkle them up to dust, sprinkle them on base of plants. Acts as slow release fertiliser. Doesnâ€™t smell at all. Note: this is experimental, not sure how well it works!!

Thanks to Ellie from [Scrumptious Garden](https://www.scrumptiousgarden.com) for heads-up about concentrated comfrey feed ðŸ™‚.
