87% of the UK [identify as White](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk). In the UK horticulture industry, the figure is 99%<sup><small>*</small></sup>.

To redress the balance, every few months I have 10 free places on my [online forest garden course](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/courses/backyard/) for people from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Simply email or message me, no proof required, all done on trust.

This is called [positive action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_action), encouraging members of protected groups (eg ethnicity) to overcome systemic disadvantage. The vast majority of feedback has been positive but a couple of individuals on a Facebook group have called it racist and illegal. It is neither. Positive action is legal, equitable and to be encouraged.

To help anyone else who wants to take positive action, I have references for the horticultural statistics and legal framework:

## <sup><small>*</small></sup>Statistics for ethnicity in horticulture

### 2.3.8 Ethnicity and background 

In terms of ethnicity, the sector is dominated by workers of British origin (approximately 95%) and other white backgrounds (approximately 3.5%). Workers of ‚Äúany other ethnic group‚Äù represented approximately 1%. Combined, workers of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and ‚Äúany other Asian background‚Äù comprise less than 0.2% of the surveyed workforce. Mixed white and Black African, Black Caribbean or Asian workers constitute 0.02%. Other ethnicities are in even lower proportions. Thus, on the basis of 901 responses, the horticulture workforce of the sector is predominantly of British origin and other white backgrounds.

## Summary of positive action in Equality Act 2010

This section applies if a person reasonably thinks that participation in an activity by persons who share a protected characteristic is disproportionately low. 

This Act does not prohibit a person from taking any action which is a proportionate means of achieving the aim of enabling or encouraging persons who share the protected characteristic to participate in that activity.

Part 11, Chapter 2, Section 158
