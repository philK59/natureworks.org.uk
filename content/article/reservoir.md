Martin Crawford has information about creating a reservoir in Agroforestry News vol 23 no. 2, [PDF available online](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product-category/publications/agroforestry-news/back-issues/) (though pricey)

## Key detail

* Design derives from maximum size of plastic pond liner: 25m x 6m (not sure if this is still the case)
* Each reservoir 3.5m x 20m x 1m deep = 70 cubic metres
* Use gravity fed where possible
* Any water fed into pipes needs to be filtered
* Circulation requires powerful pump, MC uses 4 x 180W solar panels to power [Lorentz](https://www.lorentz.de) pump
* Filter is an upwards-flow (much easier to clean) stone-gravel-grit system, using upcycled 1200 litre plastic water tank (previously used for transporting fruit juice):
  1. Bottom layer 30cm deep, 40mm stone
  2. Middle layer 30cm deep, 10mm gravel
  3. Top layer 30cm deep, 4mm grit

## _Approx_ pricing 

### Pond liner - per reservoir

* Dimensions of reservoir `w-3.5m x l-20m x d-1m = 70m³`
* Calculate size using [pond calculator](https://www.aqualinersdirect.co.uk/pond-liner-calculator)
* Dimensions of liner `w-6m x l-22.5m = 135m²`
* Quality [Firestone PondGarde Liner 1.02mm](https://www.aqualinersdirect.co.uk/pond-liners/firestone-pondgard-liner-1-02mm) £1200
* Pond underlay £200
* _Subtotal £1400_

### Pump kit

* Lorentz PS2-100
* From [Wind and Sun](https://www.windandsun.co.uk/)
* Includes solar panels
* _Subtotal £800_

### Filter

* 1000 litrew water tank IBC £70
* Stones, gravel & grit £100?
* Pipes & fittings £30
* _Subtotal £200_

### Installation 

* Digger hire £200 1 day
* Install pond liner £100 1 day 
* Fit pump & pipes £200 1 day
* _Subtotal £500_

### Totals

* Liner £1400
* Pump £800
* Filter £200
* Installation £500

**Grand total about £2,900**

Obviously, cheaper per reservoir for more reservoirs. Cheaper than a borehole (£10-15k)! Can also use cheaper liner and do some of the installation yourself.
