[Plants For A Future](https://pfaf.org/) is a brilliant online database of useful plants, invaluable for forest gardeners. They also have a lot of additional information in articles and tables. I have taken some of this data to create **sortable spreadsheets**, which means you can list plants by different characteristics.

## Sortable spreadsheets

* **[Forest Garden Spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet)** plants in [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/) by Martin Crawford, using data from [PFAF](https://pfaf.org/)
* **[Windbreak species](https://bit.ly/windbreak-spreadsheet)** from [PFAF](https://pfaf.org/user/cmspage.aspx?pageid=248)
* **[Ground cover species](https://bit.ly/ground-cover-spreadsheet)** from [PFAF](https://pfaf.org/user/cmspage.aspx?pageid=261)
* **[Native species for a Tapestry Lawn](https://bit.ly/tapestry-lawn-natives)** from the book [Tapestry Lawns](https://www.routledge.com/Tapestry-Lawns-Freed-from-Grass-and-Full-of-Flowers-1st-Edition/Smith/p/book/9780367144036) by [Lionel Smith](https://www.grassfreelawns.co.uk/index.html)
* **[Apple varieties](https://bit.ly/apple-spreadsheet)** by Chris Day
