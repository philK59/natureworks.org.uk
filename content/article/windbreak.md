Windbreak hedges are essential for protecting plants in the forest garden. There is always a balance to be struck between protection and sunlight. Generally, plant the tallest windbreak to the north, less tall to the east and the shortest on the south and west.

If you can afford the space, plant a double thickness hedge, and try to avoid gaps by using baffles or overlapping hedges.

The protection offered is about 7 times the height of the hedge eg a 5m hedge protects about 35m into the garden.

Do combine a windbreak hedge with a [dead hedge](https://www.forestgarden.wales/dead-hedge/), particularly in exposed spots as the dead hedge will give the windbreak a better chance to get established. It’s even easier if you use an existing stock hedge as one side of a dead hedge.

## Species

To support wildlife, [plant native](https://newsociety.com/Books/N/A-New-Garden-Ethic) where you can. In West Wales, these are some of the best performing native hedging plants:

* [Guelder Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus)
* [Sea Buckthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Hippophae+rhamnoides)
* [Common Barberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Berberis+vulgaris)
* [Hawthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Crataegus+monogyna)
* [Hazel](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Corylus+avellana)
* [Holly](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ilex+aquifolium)

And these are the non-natives:

* [Autumn Olive](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+umbellata)
* [Dogwood](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Cornus+sericea)
* [Juneberry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Amelanchier+canadensis)
* [Darwin’s Barberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Berberis+darwinii)
* [Japanese Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Rosa+rugosa)

[Plants For A Future](https://pfaf.org/user/Default.aspx) have a [list of plants suitable for hedging and windbreaks](https://pfaf.org/user/cmspage.aspx?pageid=248).

If you have the time, buy a few [cultivars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultivar) of your hedging plant and propagate them from cuttings. This is a cheap way to have a hedge that fruits well.

## Mulching

Oftentimes, you’ll have a neighbours [bramble](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+fruticosus) and [nettle](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Urtica+dioica) to deal with. These are fine forest garden plants in their own right but not what you want in the midst of an establishing windbreak hedge.

Woven plastic sheet mulch (use a good quality brand like [PhormiSol](https://www.phormium.com/en/applications/horticulture/black-ground-covers) or [Mypex](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mypex+weed+fabric)) comes into its own here, as it provides a barrier against [tip-layering](https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=358) bramble until the hedge is established enough to block the light out from the bramble.

Plant a single line **between** the two rows, so that the sheet can be re-used. Use metal pegs to temporarily hold down the sheet but it’s imperative to put lots of really heavy objects down, otherwise the sheet _will_ take off in the next storm! Also, be sure to put down some wood chip or hay mulch between the gaps.

In year 2, totally remove the front row of sheet mulch and fold back the rear row onto itself, and then plant the second windbreak row. Then aply a thick wood chip or bark mulch and a plant cheap and cheerful ground cover plant ([Glechoma hederacea](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Glechoma+hederacea) is a favourite, as it grows well locally). 

When the hedge is thick enough, remove the remaining sheet mulch.
