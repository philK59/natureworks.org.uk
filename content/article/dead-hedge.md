The [benefits of a dead hedge](https://www.woodlands.co.uk/blog/woodland-activities/dead-hedging-wildlife-friendly-and-people-guiding/), [made from cut branches and foliage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_hedge) are:

* Windbreak shelter for young plants whilst plant windbreaks establish
* Habitat and food source for wildlife
* Uses up surplus cuttings rather than have a bonfire

They are simple to make—bang some home-made posts in pre-made holes in the ground (6-8cm posts are easy to hammer in, smaller ones flex too much) and pile up the branches inbetween the posts. Use a big pointy iron bar to make the holes, and a [post hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_pounder) is handy as well.

We planted a [Yushania anceps 'Pitt White'](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/yushania-anceps-pitt-white/) bamboo in the Ornamental Forest Garden but it’s been battered a bit by winds, as the windbreak hedges have yet to get established, and the [Broom](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Cytisus+scoparius) nurse trees aren’t in place yet. So a dead hedge is an ideal solution.

## Top tips

* Build the dead hedge near to where you are cutting the branches.
* Use existing stock fencing as one side of the dead hedge.

The dead hedge will take a while to decompose, as the branches aren’t touching the ground. It provides ideal shelter for insects, small birds and small mammals, plus you can top the hedge with more cuttings when it starts to reduce in bulk.
