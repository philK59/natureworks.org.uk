[@AgroforestryT](https://mobile.twitter.com/AgroforestryT) has a [definition of forest gardening](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/about-agroforestry/forest-gardening/) and helpfully lists the “seven layers” of a forest garden:

1. **Canopy**—highest layer of trees, plan spacing correctly to allow enough light through to understorey
* **Small trees/shrubs**—between & below canopy trees
* **Shrubs**—mostly shade tolerant
* **Herbaceous perennials**—die back in winter, contribute to ground cover
* **Ground cover**—mostly creeping carpeting plants, with some clumping examples
* **Climbers**—require sturdy trees to climb
* **Rhizosphere**—root bearing plants and fungi
