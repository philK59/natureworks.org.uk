The monthly structured livestream is the **first Wednesday of the month** on my YouTube channel [youtube.com/c/NatureWorksGarden](https://www.youtube.com/c/NatureWorksGarden)

I would like to livestream from outside on YouTube but I need 1,000 followers to use the mobile app, so [please subscribe to my channel](https://bit.ly/subscribe-natureworksgarden) if you can!

In the meantime, I will try to livestream from the forest garden every weekday using my existing Twitch channel [twitch.tv/natureworks](https://www.twitch.tv/natureworks/)

To catch up on past livestreams, look on my [Livestream Playlist](https://bit.ly/forest-garden-livestream).
