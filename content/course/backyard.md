Whatever the size of your garden, you can create a lush food forest using forest garden techniques. Step-by-step, you’ll learn how to work with nature to grow edible crops, all the while creating a haven for wildlife.

1. **Observe & plan**<br>Where you observe, measure and document your garden to start the planning process, then on to create the map to enable the design process.
2. **Structural planting**<br>Establish the windbreaks & protective structures, start a productive perennial veg bed and plant the canopy tree layer.
3. **Fill in the structure**<br>Prepare the ground so that you can plant the shrubs and the ground cover.
A forest garden emulates the edge of woodland, working with nature to reduce the amount of watering and maintenance, with a permanent living ground cover and a self-sustaining ecosystem of nutrients & pest control. Mostly perennial plants are used, in all three dimensions, as they are more resilient, lower maintenance and more nutritious.
