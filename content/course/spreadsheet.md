### Community forest gardens for eco-homes
          
Forest gardening is growing edible crops with nature. I always recommend Martin Crawford’s seminal book [‘Creating a Forest Garden’](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/), and here are **all** the plants from the book in a spreadsheet! 

It is accessible online as a sortable Google Spreadsheet at: [bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet)

Or you can download it from here in Microsoft Excel, OpenDocument and HTML formats.
