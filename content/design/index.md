I create [forest garden](#what-is-a-forest-garden) designs that are sustainable, low maintenance and wildlife friendly. I can also implement and advise on garden landscaping. See my [portfolio](/portfolio/).

Central to the design is **working with nature**, working with what is already on-site and figuring what plants will thrive in the specific conditions. I prefer to use locally sourced materials and avoid costly groundworks where possible.

There are three stages in the process: 

1. **Plan** - survey land, write wishlist, make map
2. **Design** - arrange observations & wishlist on map
3. **Schedule** - distil series of actions

I have a standard set of tools that I use for client communication.

### Tools

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1632231917/pinterest-screenshot-83.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Pinterest" caption="Pinterest is a useful tool for collecting & sharing ideas" >}}

1. All notes are shared onlne using [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/).
2. To survey the land, I use satellite photos for a general outline, and then take measurements physically.
3. I also work from photographs and videos, supplied by the client when working remotely.
4. Liasing closely, I help the client draw up a wishlist of features and plants.
5. Images & inspiration are shared via a [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/NatureWorksGarden/) board.
6. The plants are organised on a shared [Google spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/).
7. The design is created using [CAD](https://qcad.org/en/), and shared as a [PDF file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) via Simplenote.
8. Finally, the schedule is managed on either Simplenote or the Google spreadsheet.

For an example of the Simplenote, Google Sheets and Pinterest working together, please see [these notes](https://app.simplenote.com/p/gKnbY8).

### Costing

Each job is costed individually and not by a day rate. The cost of a design really depends on the level of detail required. I can provide anything from an outline canopy and windbreak plan to detailed border planting plans with costings & suppliers.

In total, it takes about 1-2 weeks to create a garden design, with good client communication.

To help with a rough estimate of design and landscaping a 1 acre forest garden, I gave a talk in February 2021: [natureworks.org.uk/talks/costing](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/talks/costing/)

### What is a forest garden?

{{< figure src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/v1574024543/art-national-geographic-video.jpg" alt="Wooded forest garden" caption="Still from Thomas Regnault’s short film of Martin Crawford’s forest garden" >}}

#### Definition

A forest garden works with nature to grow edible crops. It is sustainable, low maintenance and wildlife friendly and emulates the woodland edge using edible perennial and ground cover plants. Essentially, it is an **edible ecosystem**. 

#### Characteristics

1. **Sustainable** — provides its own nutrients and pest control
2. **Productive** — range of harvests from multiple layers
3. **Wildlife friendly** — biodiversity encouraged, native plants where possible
4. **Layers** — use all available space
5. **Perennial** — lower maintenance, more nutritious

#### Features

1. **Windbreaks** — integral hedges & dead hedges
2. **Spacing** — enough for lower storeys
3. **Ground cover** — ultimately permanent living cover
4. **Nutrients** — supplied by garden system plants
