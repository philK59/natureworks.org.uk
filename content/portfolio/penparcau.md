### Forest garden practicality & loose Georgian elegance
          
Set on a gently sloping, West-facing rear garden, Penparcau presents a real opportunity to showcase native wild flowers and forest garden plants in an almost formal setting. The garden can be divided into four areas: the well-defined ‘Sunbowl’ of tapered vegetation forming a natural amphitheatre, the curved perennial vegetable beds to the West defined by the existing path, the orchard along the North boundary and the woodland fire pit to the East.

The Sunbowl provides a natural suntrap, a place to demonstrate the diversity and crossover of native and forest garden plants, and also a way of providing discreet access across the garden, through the semi-circular beds.

The suggested planting plan for the Sunbowl beds are a mix of deciduous and semi-evergreen shrubs, from the petite [Aronia x prunifolia](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Aronia+prunifolia) ['Viking'](https://www.thompson-morgan.com/p/aronia-x-prunifolia-viking/t66056TM) to the statuesque [Saskatoon](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Amelanchier+alnifolia) and [Guelder Rose](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Viburnum+opulus) at the back, mixing in native [Dogwood](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Cornus+sanguinea) and [Privet](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Ligustrum+vulgare) along the way.

The second bed contains the architectural [Globe Artichoke](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Cynara+scolymus) at the back, flanked by [Meadowsweet](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Filipendula+ulmaria) and [Ox-eye Daisy](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Leucanthemum+vulgare), with a bank of [Knapweed](https://pfaf.org/USER/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Centaurea+nigra) and [Ice Plant sedum](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Sedum+spectabile) tapering down to [Sweet Cicely](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Myrrhis+odorata), [Yarrow](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Achillea+millefolium) and [Lamb's Ear](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/17707/stachys-byzantina/details).

The third and lowest bed is home to [English Lavender](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Lavandula+angustifolia), a carpet of [Maiden Pink](https://www.brc.ac.uk/plantatlas/plant/dianthus-deltoides) and possibly [Sea Holly](https://www.brc.ac.uk/plantatlas/plant/eryngium-maritimum).

>A forest garden can so readily incorporate ornamental elements that echo and complement the surroundings
          
There are half a dozen established apple trees in the rest of the garden, supplemented by [Asian Pear](https://pfaf.org/USER/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Pyrus%20pyrifolia%20culta), [Apple Serviceberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Amelanchier+lamarckii), [Medlar](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Mespilus+germanica) and [Autumn Olive](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+umbellata).

Across the mini-windbreak row of various currants and into the curved beds of the perennial veg area, low evergreen ground cover of [Nepalese Raspberry](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Rubus+nepalensis) and [Taiwanese Bramble](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Rubus+rolfei) allow a variety of perennial vegetables to grow through, whilst suppressing weeds. 

To the East of the garden, sheltered from the prevailing westerlies by the Sunbowl shrubs, there is a woodland area planted up around the existing circular firepit.
