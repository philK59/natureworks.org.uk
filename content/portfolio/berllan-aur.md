### Community forest gardens for eco-homes
          
Berllan Aur (‘Golden Orchard’ in English) is a 15 dwelling eco-home development on the outskirts of Boncath, Pembrokeshire. 

The developer [Western Solar](https://westernsolar.org.uk/) has created near-[Passivhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house) standard [Ty Solar](https://tysolar.co.uk/) houses, powered by solar panels and batteries.

The verges and gardens of the 10 affordable homes are created along forest garden principles, with edible shrubs for hedges, a range of fruit trees, native & edible climers, permanent living ground cover and UK native wild flowers.

The design attempts to incorporate the widest range possible of fruit bushes, including [Blackcurrant](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ribes+nigrum), [Redcurrant](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Ribes+rubrum), [Honeyberry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Lonicera+caerulea), [Japanese Quince](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Chaenomeles+japonica), [Jostaberry](https://pfaf.org/USER/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Ribes+x+culverwellii) and [Chuckleberry](https://www.shootgardening.co.uk/plant/ribes-chuckleberry). The fruit trees are chosen both to provide a range of different fruit ([apples](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples), [plums](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/plums), [Asian Pear](https://pfaf.org/USER/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Pyrus+pyrifolia+culta), [cherries](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/cherries)) and also a range of different fruiting times, so that the harvest is spread over a [longer period](https://www.orangepippintrees.com/pollinationchecker.aspx).

There are also 6 north-facing, native, mini-woodland gardens. These include wildflowers such as [Columbine](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Aquilegia+vulgaris), [Foxglove](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Digitalis+purpurea), [Yarrow](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Achillea+millefolium), [Meadowsweet](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Filipendula+ulmaria) and [Hedge Woundwort](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=stachys+sylvatica), all great for a range of pollinators.

There are a few edibles in the woodland gardens as well, including [Hosta'Royal Standard'](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/91937/hosta-royal-standard/details) and [Hosta sieboldiana 'Elegans'](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/99289/hosta-sieboldiana-var-elegans/details), plus some [Rhubarb](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Rheum+rhaponticum) ['Timperley Early'](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Rheum+rhaponticum).

There is the potential of creating an extensive community forest garden, with shared vegetable beds, community area, tool shed and polytunnel.
