### Low-maintenance holiday garden
          
The original design was for curved herb and wild flower beds, providing shelter and screening for a hot tub, barbeque and green roof seating area. A water bowl and semicircular beds on the the balustrade provided additional planting and intimacy to the space.

Unfortunately, the builder pulled out of construction. The remaining beds are by the front door, the patio wall and the gable end.

There is no water bowl alas, but I have taken the opportunity to plant up the available beds with a mixture of wild flowers and forest garden plants. These include [Everlasting Pea](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Lathyrus+latifolius), [Field Scabious](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Knautia+arvensis), [Self Heal](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunella+vulgaris), [Hyssop](https://pfaf.org/USER/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Hyssopus+officinalis) and [Creeping Thyme](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Thymus+serpyllum) by the house.

In the gable end bed, there’s a beautiful ['James Galway'](https://www.davidaustinroses.co.uk/products/james-galway-climbing-rose) climbing rose, above [Iberian Comfrey](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/75444/Symphytum-ibericum/Details), [Solomon's Seal](https://pfaf.org/USER/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Polygonatum+odoratum), [Hosta sieboldiana](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Hosta+sieboldiana) and a smörgåsbord of other native and ornamental flowers.

At the foot of the patio wall, there is a curved bed by the track. There are three adjacent climbers leading from the sun into the shade: a Wisteria 'Issai Perfect', a [nativar](https://grownative.org/learn/natives-cultivars-and-nativars/) [honeysuckle 'Belgica'](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/52050/lonicera-periclymenum-belgica/details), and another nativar, [Ivy 'Buttercup'](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/50160/hedera-helix-buttercup/details).

The flowers in the bed include [Beach Strawberry](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Fragaria+chiloensis) ground cover, [Chives](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Allium+schoenoprasum), [Yarrow](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Achillea+millefolium), white [Foxglove](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Digitalis+purpurea), [Ice Plant sedum](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Sedum+spectabile) and [Hedge Woundwort](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=stachys+sylvatica).

>A low-maintenance mixture of wild flower, ornamental and edibles for a Welsh holiday cottage

For a future stage of landscaping, I designed a low-maintenance forest garden for the back of the house.
