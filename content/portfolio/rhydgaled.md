### Outline design for a keen forest gardener

Having a keen forest gardener as a client is actually a boon for a forest garden designer! It means I get to talk about plants and forest gardens for much longer than is normally socially acceptable. I created an outline plan (which is the canopy, windbreak and shrub layers) for Daniel and Sara for a 1 acre site in Ceredigion.

<img class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="CAD garden design" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_800/v1632140301/rhydgaled/rhydgaled-om-cad.png">

The key to the design was to link up the garden with a split level patio and an existing orchard and vegetable bed to the south. The trick was to supply enough detail as planting suggestions without restricting options further down the line.

The planting is dominated by the two beautifully architectural [Stone Pines](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Pinus+pinea) (_eventually_ providing a crop of pine nuts), and the [Sweet Chestnut](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Castanea+sativa) ['Marigoule'](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/chestnut-castanea-marigoule/). I squeezed in a pollinating partner ['Belle Epine'](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/chestnut-castanea-sativa-belle-epine-2/) into the hedge! 

Nestled within the trees is levelled grass circle for exercise.

The field slopes gently upward to the northern boundary, a substantial [Autumn Olive](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Elaeagnus+umbellata) and [Sea Buckthorn](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Hippophae+rhamnoides) windbreak hedge. Shelter is provided for the [Date Plums](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Diospyros+lotus) and [Asian Pear](https://pfaf.org/USER/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Pyrus+pyrifolia+culta) by another productive and substantial windbreak consisting of [Aronia x prunifolia](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Aronia+prunifolia) ['Viking'](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Aronia+prunifolia).

The area to the South of the property is filled with pollarded trees for leaf crops ([Small-leaved Lime](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Tilia+cordata), [Chinese Cedar](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Toona+sinensis), [White Mulberry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Morus+alba)) plus plum and cherry trees to supplement the well-established apple trees by the picnic area. Protected by a [dead hedge](https://www.forestgarden.wales/dead-hedge), this area adjoins the annual and perennial vegetable plots, and the polytunnel
