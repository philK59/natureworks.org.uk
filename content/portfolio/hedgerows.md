### Productive, low-maintenance, village forest garden
          
Combining a mixture of vegetables, established hedges and forest garden, this medium-sized, gently sloping and south-facing rear garden provides plentiful opportunity for produce and wildlife.

The original design was quite traditional in some ways, almost a [parterre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parterre) in the near symmetrical division of the 6 areas, centered on an ornamental and edible ['Morello' cherry](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/cherries/morello) on a [semi-dwarfing rootstock](https://walcotnursery.co.uk/rootstocks/).

Due to the Covid pandemic, the design was altered to include a large vegetable patch in the centre, whilst retaining the paths.

Flanking the entrance to the garden, there are two standard [Bay trees](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Laurus+Nobilis) in pots, ornamental evergreen herbs making the most of the southerly aspect. These are echoed in the beds by an upright [Amelanchier alnifolia 'Obelisk'](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/154903/amelanchier-alnifolia-obelisk-(pbr)/details) to the right, and an autumnally stunning [Rhus aromtica](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Rhus+aromatica) to the left.

In the shadow of the house, the shade bed is filled with [hostas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosta), [Ostrich Fern](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Matteuccia+struthiopteris), [redcurrants and whitecurrants](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Ribes+rubrum). As you move into the light, the more sun-loving plants comes to the fore, including apple ['Annie Elizabeth'](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples/annie-elizabeth), ['Golden Delicious'](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples/golden-delicious), [Day Lillies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylily) and [Raspberry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Rubus+idaeus).

Towards the top of the garden, the more traditional annual raised beds house the more light-demanding annual vegetables, plus a seating area and miniature pond.

The thick and established hedges are fantastic habitat, and it’s always a good idea to consider incorporating established plants within a design, particularly if they’re native species. The west hedge is also home to [European Honeysuckle](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Lonicera+periclymenum) and [Travellers Joy](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Clematis+vitalba). Also on the west side is an existing [Field Maple](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Acer+campestre) with its crown raised, providing a glorious autumn display as well being a [food source for over 100 native insects](https://www.brc.ac.uk/dbif/hostsresults.aspx?hostid=69).
