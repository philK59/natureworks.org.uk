### “A green room in which to lose ourselves”
          
The brief was to deliver a design that creates a sense of seclusion and enclosure with plants, whilst accomodating the existing garden structure and providing a range of habitats, features and food sources for wildlife.

The West-facing garden is 18m x 6m and to minimise disruption I wanted to work with the existing structure of a seating area and a lawn. 

The paved seating area at the end was extended by removing the overbearing Leylandii and then planted with an ornamental hawthorn [Broad-leaved Cockspur Thorn 'Prunifolia'](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/89242/Crataegus-persimilis-Prunifolia/Details), the north border screened with a non-invasive [Fargesia robusta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargesia_robusta) bamboo and the seating area sheltered by an [Italian Alder](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Alnus+cordata) with its crown raised.

The curved lawn is separated by an existing [Fig tree](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Ficus+carica) and [Irish Yew](https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/95998/taxus-baccata-fastigiata-(f)/details) and is bordered on the south by a small [English Lavender](https://pfaf.org/User/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Lavandula+angustifolia) hedge, with shady herbaceous borders to the south and a miniature wildlife pond on the sunlit north fence beneath a [Star Jasmine](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Trachelospermum+jasminoides).

More dwarfing fruit trees [Crabapple 'Laura'](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/124642/Malus-Laura/Details), [Damson](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Prunus+insititia) on [Pixy rootstock](https://walcotnursery.co.uk/rootstocks/) and an [Apple](https://www.orangepippin.com/varieties/apples) on [M9 rootstock](https://walcotnursery.co.uk/rootstocks/) are positioned in other aspects so as to maximise westerly and southerly light.

Throughout the design, there is a push to include wildlife friendly species and habitat, including [Fennel](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Foeniculum+vulgare), [Sweet Cicely](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?LatinName=Myrrhis+odorata), [Lungwort](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Pulmonaria+officinalis), [Wild Oregano](https://pfaf.org/user/plant.aspx?latinname=Origanum+vulgare), [Wild Thyme](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/105763/Thymus-polytrichus-A-Kern-ex-Borbas-subsp-britannicus-(Ronniger)-Kerguelen/Details) and [Wood Betony](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Stachys+officinalis). And there are [Dwarf Comfrey](https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/75444/Symphytum-ibericum/Details), [Rubus](https://pfaf.org/User/plant.aspx?LatinName=Rubus+nepalensis) and [strawberry](https://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Fragaria+chiloensis) ground covers, plus a spiky [Berberis buxifolia 'Nana'](https://www.thompson-morgan.com/p/berberis-buxifolia-nana/t58097TM) for shelter by the pond.

Other wildlife features include the wildlife pond, the open compost heap, the [green roof](https://www.grassroofcompany.co.uk/our-juice) on the shed, [hedgehog highways](https://www.hedgehogstreet.org/help-hedgehogs/link-your-garden/) and various logpiles.
