### Sortable forest garden plant spreadsheet
          
Forest gardening is growing edible crops with nature. I always recommend Martin Crawford’s seminal book [‘Creating a Forest Garden’](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/), and here are **all** the plants from the book in a spreadsheet! 

It is accessible online as a sortable Google Spreadsheet at:

### [bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet)

Here are instructions on how to use it:

Or you can download it from here in Microsoft Excel, OpenDocument and HTML formats.

Spreadsheet created by Jake Rayson, Olly Boon & Chris Day. Data with thanks from [Plants For A Future](https://pfaf.org).
