### How to plan your forest garden
          
A  mini-course on how to plan a forest garden. Includes bonus Design section plus free planning checklist, plus lots of extra links and information.

* Forest garden definition
* Practical PDF checklist
* Things to observe
* How to make a map
* BONUS design section on bringing it all together

I totally recommend that you buy a copy of Martin Crawford’s seminal book [Creating a Forest Garden](https://www.agroforestry.co.uk/product/creating-a-forest-garden-2/). As an additional planning resource, I helped create an online sortable spreadsheet of all the plants in his book [bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet](https://bit.ly/forest-garden-spreadsheet/)
