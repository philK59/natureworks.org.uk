### Bring your forest garden ideas!

_Workshop slideshows & notes always available at [natureworks.org.uk/realtime](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/realtime/)_

A realtime workshop on the first two Monday evenings of every month, where you can learn about how to create a wildlife friendly, edible and low maintenance forest garden.

No matter the size of your plot, you can provide habitat and food for yourself and for wildlife by creating a sustainable, gently managed ecosystem.

The two sessions are each divided into two parts: a 1 hour livestreamed public lecture, 10 minutes public Q&A on the chat, and then a private, paid-for 40 minute Zoom meeting for a maximum of 6 students.

After each session, there is an assignment to practise your new found forest garden skills. Students are encouraged to use a real world site.

The content of the two lectures:

1. **Plan** — Observations, measurements, wishlists, map and design. All of these are tightly packed into a densely nutritious, whistlestop lecture about starting outing with your project. [natureworks.org.uk/realtime/plan](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/realtime/plan/)
2. **Plant** — Protection, windbreaks, structures, canopy layer, shrubs and ground cover. Phew 😅, make sure to leave room in your brain for this smörgåsbord of practical advice. [natureworks.org.uk/realtime/plant](https://www.natureworks.org.uk/realtime/plant/)

As well as a Zoom invite link and password, paying students will also receive an invite to the Telegram forest garden group, a friendly group of like minded souls.
